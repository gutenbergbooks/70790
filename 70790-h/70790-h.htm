  <h2 class='c005'>A RECOMMENDATION BY OUR <abbr title='Reverend'>REV.</abbr> FATHER PROVINCIAL</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'><abbr title='Reverend'>Rev.</abbr> Dear Father:</p>
<p class='c006'>It gives me pleasure to say a few words in praise
of the new book of <abbr title='Father'>Fr.</abbr> Charles Coppens on the Spiritual
Exercises of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius. Any new power that
will help us to use these spiritual arms of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius
more effectively deserves the hearty approval of every
Jesuit. The volume is intended for the use of Ours
only, and will be found of great service in conducting
retreats or in giving the Triduums that take place twice
a year before the renovation of vows.</p>

<p class='c007'>The customary meditations are well arranged, are
solid, and at the same time practical. The points are
proposed very clearly so as to be readily remembered.</p>

<p class='c007'>I bespeak for this volume the good will of all of
Ours, and trust it may be of great help to a more effective
giving of the exercises and be in the hands of
all.</p>

  <h2 id='preface' class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The Text of the Spiritual Exercises of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius,
as translated into English from the Spanish Autograph,
and edited for private circulation by <abbr title='Reverend'>Rev.</abbr> John
Morris, <abbr class='spell'>S. J.</abbr>, is printed in a small volume of only
125 pages. That little work contains all that the
Saint composed in the Grotto of Manresa, and he
never afterward wrote any additions to the text. But
in explaining his Exercises to his first companions,
and to others who made the retreat under his direction,
he would adapt the details to their characters and the
various circumstances. His followers did the same,
without writing further additions or commentaries on
the original text; they followed in their practice the
traditional method as it had come to them from their
saintly founder.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the course of time, as was natural, considerable
departures from the first process took place, some of
which induced the danger of gradually losing the very
spirit of the original Exercises. Among the learned
men of our Society who labored most successfully to
check such tendency, one of the most distinguished
was the Father General John Roothaan, who in 1834
addressed a circular letter to all his subjects, earnestly
warning them against this peril. At the same time
he furnished them a masterly work on the original
Spanish and Latin texts, which he accompanied with
a most valuable commentary.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>For those preferring a Latin guide book, whether in
making the Exercises themselves, or in explaining them
to others, no work is more commendable than that masterpiece
of Father Roothaan. Still, both before and
since its publication, many other editions of the Exercises
and commentaries on the same have been printed,
both in Latin and in various modern languages, with
full approbation and warm commendations of the
Superiors of the Society; and excellent reasons appear
to exist why successive generations of Jesuits should
continue their efforts to enrich this valuable literature.
In particular the eight days retreat, which all our members
perform every year, gains additional interest and
impressiveness when a wider range is presented, affording
a choice among a large number of approved
guide books to direct them through this fertile region
of spirituality.</p>

<p class='c007'>The spirit permeating all of these must ever be the
same, so too the main outline of the truths proposed
and the general plan of the Exercises. Yet experience
shows that there remains a wide room for variety
in comments, suggestions and practical applications.
Therefore, when the time for each one’s annual retreat
comes round, there is shown by many Fathers an earnest
desire for some late publication on the subject, that
will lend new zest to the familiar solid doctrine. To
satisfy such reasonable wishes is the chief reason why
the present pages are modestly presented to his brethren

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>THE SPIRITUAL EXERCISES OF <abbr title='Saint'>ST.</abbr> IGNATIUS</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='prepar' class='c010'>PREPARATORY CONSIDERATION</h2>
</div>
<h3 class='c011'><abbr title='one'>I</abbr></h3>
<p class='c006'>The days of the retreat are the most important in
the year. 1. <i>The most important for the Exercitant</i>;
for his principal duty and highest interest are the salvation
and spiritual progress of his own soul: “Seek
ye first the Kingdom of God, and his justice, and all
these things shall be added unto you.” What would
it profit any of us to convert even thousands, if he
loses his own soul? And if any one imagines that
his own salvation is already secured, and no longer
needs his principal care, he is a very ignorant or a conceited
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>These days are the most important for the salvation
of our neighbor</i>; since, the more one becomes
a man of God, as a good retreat tends to make him,
the better he will do the work of God. And the salvation
of souls is pre-eminently the work of God, not
that of human talent or industry.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>They are the most important for the glory of
God</i>; since the glory we render to God is in proportion
to our holiness, the purity of our intentions, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>ardor of our love and our other virtues; the increase
of all of which is the direct purpose of the retreat.</p>
<h3 class='c011'><abbr title='two'>II</abbr></h3>
<p class='c006'>The yearly retreat is important for all religious,
whatever be the spiritual condition of their souls.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>Those who are leading fervent lives</i> are likely
to receive during it special lights and graces enabling
them to draw nearer to their Divine Lord; <span lang="la"><i>Amice,
ascende superius</i></span>, “Friend, come up higher.” The
Holy Ghost is ever laboring at the sanctification of
souls, of such especially as show themselves deserving
of peculiar love by their faithful co-operation. Now
this fidelity is most strikingly exhibited when we abandon
all earthly cares to devote our whole hearts to the
loving worship of the Lord, as we do in a retreat.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Such souls as are gradually allowing their fervor
to cool</i> amidst the distracting cares of an active life
stand in special need of the Spiritual Exercises, to arrest
their downward course.</p>

<p class='c007'>When one runs down a hill, his descent is accelerated
by his own weight, and he needs special help to
avoid a serious fall. Such is the case of those who
are losing their fervor, and a good retreat provides
the remedy.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>If any have unfortunately already lost their
balance</i>, and are hurrying along to destruction by the
commission of serious faults, or by yielding to a no
less dangerous tendency to tepidity, a good retreat is
almost the only way of saving them from ruin. In
connection with these thoughts it is well to reflect that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>some one of our annual retreats will be our last; it may
be the present one. Many of those who made the retreat
last year are now in eternity; and not a few of
them saw no more reason then to expect so early
an end than we do now.</p>
<h3 class='c011'><abbr title='three'>III</abbr></h3>
<p class='c006'>It is very consoling for those who enter on these
Spiritual Exercises to remember that their efficacy for
good is far greater than men are apt to imagine; they
are not merely human, but in some respects Divine;
hence their extraordinary power to sanctify us.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>These exercises are Divine in the truths they
teach us</i>; for they consist chiefly of meditations on the
word of God; and the word of God is the seed of salvation:
<span lang="la"><i>Semen est verbum Dei</i></span>. It is not the learning
of philosophers or scientists that brings us eternal life,
but the teachings of Christ; and these are the power
working in the retreat.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>These Exercises are Divine in the principal
director</i> who conducts them; for in them the Spirit of
God instructs and enlightens the soul of the exercitant
and sanctifies it. The printed page containing these
teachings, or the Father Master who explains them is
not the chief power at work during the retreat, no
more than the audible voice of Christ converted and
sanctified the souls of His hearers. God speaks to our
heart in the retreat, saying, “Hear, O my people, and
I will speak.... I am God, thy God” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 49).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Not only the several truths considered during
these days are the word of God, but the <i>whole plan of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>these Spiritual Exercises is in a true sense Divine</i>.
For no one who is familiar with the facts of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Ignatius’ life can believe that he had acquired, at the
time when he produced this masterpiece of sacred wisdom,
such knowledge of the spiritual life as it exhibits
on every page. When he came to Manresa, he was a
mere novice in spirituality. And in fact he himself
always felt convinced that he owed these Exercises
to Divine illumination. Thus, as Bartoli relates, “on
one occasion the Saint confessed to Father Laynez that
one hour of prayer at Manresa had taught him more
concerning spiritual things than he could have learned
from the instructions of the wisest doctors” (Life,
<abbr title='one'>I.</abbr> <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 57).</p>

<p class='c007'>The object which this unique book has accomplished
was to reduce the direction of soul to a science, that
bases on certain principles of faith an exact and positive
method, which, guided by the rules prescribed, insures
almost infallible success. Considering the circumstances
in which it was written we cannot but attribute
this work to superhuman aid. Hence its wonderful
efficiency, testified to by countless witnesses, and
continued in the experience of three centuries till the
present day.</p>
<h3 class='c011'><abbr title='four'>IV</abbr></h3>
<p class='c006'>Hence the <i>high esteem in which these Spiritual Exercises
are held</i> by the best judges in such matters.
For instance, when the learned Pope Leo <abbr title='the thirteenth'>XIII</abbr> wished
to select the best means by which he might prepare himself
and his domestic prelates to gain the plenary indulgence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>of the jubilee year 1900, he had two of our
Fathers conduct in his palace the Exercises of the retreat;
and, at his advanced age of over 90 years, he
attended in person nearly all the meditations. His successor,
Pope Pius <abbr title='the tenth'>X</abbr>, gave similar marks of his esteem
for these Exercises. There exists in our society a
venerable tradition, which seems to date back to the
earliest years of the Institute, to the effect that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Ignatius was specially assisted by the Blessed Mother
of God in composing his unique masterpiece. The inhabitants
of Manresa, some years after his death, embodied
this tradition in a beautiful painting, which they
placed in the cave, representing him as kneeling before
the figure of the Blessed Mother and Child, with his
eyes fixed upon her lips, and his right hand extended
as if ready to write what she dictated to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>Father Henry Watrigant, <abbr class='spell'>S. J.</abbr>, relates that this tradition
has been confirmed at various times by well
authenticated revelations. Thus he says: “The venerable
Father Louis de Ponte narrates that, when in
the year 1600 Ours entered on their annual retreat, his
penitent, the venerable Marina de Escobar, also began
her retreat; and the Archangel Gabriel appeared to her
and said that the Blessed Virgin Mary had been as it
were the foundress of those Exercises, having instructed
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius to put them in that form.”</p>
<h3 class='c011'><abbr title='five'>V</abbr></h3>
<p class='c006'>Having now understood what efficiency is attached
to a good retreat, we naturally ask ourselves <i>what we
must do to secure these precious results</i>. We must:</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>1. Enter seriously into that deep recollection which
is the proper atmosphere for a retreat, avoiding during
it all unnecessary intercourse with the outside
world.</p>

<p class='c007'>“God and I” should be the only objects of my
thoughts; all else is a hindrance to perfect success.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. We must diligently apply our mental powers to
master the truths proposed to us; for that purpose <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Ignatius bids us occupy ourselves during a full hour in
each of the meditations or contemplations assigned.
He adds that, “in time of desolation, the exercitant, in
order to go against the desolation, and to overcome the
temptation, must always remain a short time beyond
the full hour, so as to accustom himself, not only to
resist the enemy, but even to overthrow him” (<abbr title='Annotation'>Ann.</abbr>
13).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. In the <abbr title='fifth'>5th</abbr> Annotation the Saint says: “It will
much benefit him who is receiving the Exercises to enter
upon them with a large heart and with liberality
towards the Creator and Lord, offering all his desires
and liberty to Him, in order that His Divine Majesty
may make use of his person and of all he possesses according
to His most holy will.” He says elsewhere:
“The more liberal one shall show himself towards God,
the more liberal he shall find God towards him, and the
more fit he shall daily be to receive in greater abundance
His graces and spiritual gifts” (Rule 19).</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Both during the meditations and at all other
times of prayer, great fervor should be employed to
obtain from the Lord those copious graces which He
has in store for us, and which He desires to bestow;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>but it is a general law of His providence that they must
be eagerly asked for, and to the best of our power deserved
by our efforts and co-operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>If these means are diligently employed, we can indulge
a quiet confidence of great results; for the Lord
does not invite us to a rich banquet without providing
for the full satisfaction of His guests.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>
  <h2 id='day1' class='c005'>THE FIRST DAY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The first day of the retreat is mainly devoted to what
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius calls “<i>The Principle and Foundation</i>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Christ bids us act like “a wise man that built his
house upon a rock,—and it fell not because it was
founded on a rock” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Matth. vii, 24). The
truth now considered is the rock on which the whole
structure of our spirituality is to be built. Bartoli, in
his life of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, narrates that a learned Doctor
of the University of Paris, Martin Olave, used to say
that one single hour spent in meditating on this foundation
had taught him more than long years of theological
studies. Such too has been the experience of many
others. Father Everard Mercurian spoke of this foundation
as alone sufficient to effect the most astonishing
changes in a soul, by uprooting all its earthly affections
and directing its desires to God alone.</p>
<h3 id='day1-m1' class='c001'>THE FIRST MEDITATION <br> On the End of Man</h3>
<p class='c006'>The first part of the Foundation is: “<i>Man was
created to praise, reverence and serve God our Lord,
and by this means to save his soul.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>To begin any of our meditations well, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius
bids us stand, for the space of a <span lang="la"><i>Pater Noster</i></span>, one or
two paces from the place at which we are to meditate,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>and with our mind raised on high, consider how God
looks down upon us, and then adore Him with an act
of reverence and self-humiliation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then follows the <i>Preparatory Prayer</i>, which is also
the same for all the meditations. It is to ask our Lord
for grace that all the acts of our memory, our understanding
and our will may throughout the meditation
tend directly to the service and praise of the Divine
Majesty.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine your Blessed Saviour appears
before you, looking lovingly on you and saying: “My
son, I am now going to teach you the first truth in the
spiritual life.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg that you may understand this
truth as the Saints have understood it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr></i> Consider the words, “<i>Man was created.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>1. “<i>Man.</i>” What is man? Compared to God,
man is a mere nothing, like a little gnat flitting in the
sunshine; yet among material things man is a masterpiece,
endowed with the most wonderful powers and
potentialities. Man is like a musical instrument, from
which the Divine Spirit can draw the most exquisite
harmony, as He has done from millions of saintly
souls. But if not responsive to His touch, it gives out
harsh and false sounds, marring the harmony of God’s
world. A man may live like an Angel, or like a demon
or like a brute animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Man was “<i>created</i>,” that is, made out of nothing,
for so was the world; now even a savage understands
that the thing made belongs to the maker.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>Therefore I belong to God; He can do with me and require
of me what He pleases.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II.</abbr></i> Consider what God requires of man.
If God has made man for a purpose, He certainly requires
of him to work for that purpose. But God
can do nothing without a purpose, a purpose worthy
of Himself; His wisdom requires that. Now He alone
is worthy of Himself; therefore He directed all things
to Himself, as the Book of Proverbs says: “The
Lord hath made all things for Himself” (<abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 4).</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not that God needs any creature; for being all
perfect He is self-sufficient; but right order requires
that He make all His creatures tend to Him.</p>

<p class='c007'>How then must all creatures tend to God? By
glorifying Him; that is by <i>praising, reverencing and
serving God</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>Praising God.</i> To praise God is to show forth
and proclaim His excellence. The Psalms are full of
such praises; for instance Psalm 116: “Praise the
Lord, all ye nations, praise Him all ye people.” We
must not live then to exalt ourselves, or to get others
to praise us, but render all honor to God, to whom it
all belongs.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Reverencing God</i>, worshipping Him, as we do
when we pray. Thus the Angels in Heaven ever do,
crying out; “Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Almighty”
(<abbr title='Apocalypse'>Ap.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 8). Thus we put statues of Angels on the
altar to express our reverence for the Blessed Sacrament.
Thus we should express our reverence for God
whenever we speak to Him in prayer. How do I
pray habitually? With what reverence of bodily posture
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>and of mental attitude? We should thus make
our meditations practical.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>Serving God.</i> To serve another is to do his bidding;
we are then created to be ever at the disposal of
God, to obey Him whenever He makes known His
will: “If you love me, keep my commandments,” He
says.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III.</abbr></i> Consider the further consequences of
our praise, reverence and service of God; “<i>And by
these means to save his soul</i>,” that is to attain eternal
happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>The good God has so wisely and bountifully ordained
all things that by glorifying Him we glorify
ourselves and reach the fulfilment of all our desires.
But by refusing to glorify Him we degrade and utterly
ruin ourselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now we are made free to do the one or the other.
This freedom is a wonderful gift, a glorious gift in
one way, making us like to God and capable of securing
our own bliss forever, with God’s grace, of course:
but on the other hand putting on us a terrible responsibility.
No other power on earth can control a man’s
liberty. When <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Agnes, a mere child of 13 years,
refused to do wrong, the whole power of the Roman
Empire could not bend her will; on the other hand,
the influence of the holiest education cannot make a
child virtuous without its free co-operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Can a man then, by refusing to serve God, deprive
the Creator of the glory that he was intended to render
Him? Certainly not; but he can freely choose to
glorify the goodness of God by faithful service, thus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>securing at the same time perfect happiness for himself,
or choose to glorify God’s justice by his eternal
punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with God Almighty, my Creator, and
with Christ, my Redeemer; that I may do my full duty
and secure eternal bliss.</p>
<h3 id='day1-m2' class='c011'>THE SECOND MEDITATION <br> On the End of Creatures</h3>
<p class='c006'>The second part of the foundation says: “<i>And the
other things upon the face of the earth were created
for man, and to help him to attain the end for which
he was created. Whence it follows that man must
make use of them in so far as they help him to attain
his end; and in the same way he ought to withdraw
himself from them in so far as they hinder him from it.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>The task of the exercitant is three-fold:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Intellectual: he must strive to understand the
truths proposed correctly, clearly and fully;</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Practical: he must apply the truths to his own
conduct;</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Prayerful: so as to obtain aid from Heaven to
succeed in both these respects.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Preparatory Prayer</i> is the same as in the first
meditation. It is so too in all the following meditations.
It will not be necessary to remind the exercitant
of this in the subsequent exercises.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you behold our Dear Lord
before you, who says: “My son, I will now teach you
the second truth of the spiritual life.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Grant, O Dear Lord, that I may understand
it fully and learn from it how to improve my
conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr></i> Consider these words: “<i>The other
things upon the face of the earth are created for man</i>:”
and man for God. Here is a clear exhibition of God’s
wisdom; the inanimate is for the vegetable world, the
vegetable for the animal, and all for man; inferior
things are for the real good of superior ones. I am
not then created for material enjoyment: <span lang="la"><i>Ad majora
natus sum</i></span>, “I am born for greater things,” I must not
degrade myself by the perverse gratification of my animal
nature.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II.</abbr></i> Consider the words: “<i>And in order
to attain the end for which he was created</i>.” How do
the other things aid man to attain his end? In various
ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some things need only be considered to raise man’s
heart to God and prompt him to reverence the Divine
Majesty. “The heavens show forth the glory of God,
and the firmament declares the work of his hands,”
etc. (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 18).</p>

<p class='c007'>Other creatures are for the use of man, as food,
drink, clothing, etc. Others are to be endured, that
he may practise submission to God’s holy will; such as
excessive heat and cold, sickness, death, etc. Others
are to be abstained from, as was the forbidden fruit in
Paradise.</p>

<p class='c007'>Everything thus becomes for man a stepping stone
to Heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III.</abbr></i> “<i>Whence it follows that man must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>make use of them in so far as they help him to attain
his end; and in the same way he ought to withdraw
himself from them in as far as they hinder him from it.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'>Consider how this rule may be observed or violated.
For instance, <abbr class='spell'>(a)</abbr> In our use of food and drink. The
relish attached to the use of them is good as a means
to promote our health; but under its influence excess
is often committed, by which health may be injured,
disease contracted and life shortened. Am I always
blameless in this respect?</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>(b)</abbr> Sleep may be excessive and lead to the neglect
of duty.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>(c)</abbr> The study of nature, of the sciences and the
fine arts may greatly promote the glory of God and
indirectly the good of souls, and it may be wrong to
neglect it; but it may also be abused; it is only a means,
and must not be made an end in itself, to the neglect
of our true end.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>(d)</abbr> Such too is the reading of literature or of the
news of the day.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>(e)</abbr> Such is our intercourse with superiors, our

<h3 id='day1-c' class='c011'>CONSIDERATION <br> On the End of the Religious Life</h3>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='one'>I</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'>When we consider the conduct of men generally, we
see at a glance that the lives of vast numbers of them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>are not in conformity with the truths we have been
studying; and we are reminded of the words of Christ:
“Wide is the gate and broad the way that leadeth to
destruction, and many there are that go in thereat.
How narrow is the gate and straight the way that leadeth
to life, and few there are that find it” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr>
<abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 13, 14). Of course the way of salvation, owing
to His preaching and His merits, is now much wider
than when He spoke those words; but yet it appears
to be, through men’s own fault, much narrower than
it should be. What is the condition of religious in this
respect? It is well worth while to examine what is
the effect of our religious vocation on the most important
of all our interests, the attaining of the end
for which we were created. Now it is clear that the
religious life offers many great advantages for that
purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. We are created to <i>praise, reverence and serve</i>
God. Now the religious life is entirely directed to
these objects. 1. We are constantly employed in the
promotion of the <i>praise</i> and glory of God: all our
labors are directed to it; the place we live in, the occupations
assigned us and all the circumstances of them
are selected with a view of this purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The <i>reverence</i> shown to God is continually fostered
by a long succession of common and private
prayers, Holy Masses, recitation of the Divine Office,
visits to the Blessed Sacrament, etc., from morning
till night, day after day, year after year, till death.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The <i>service</i> of God, the accomplishment of His
holy will, is not confined to the observance of His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Commandments and those of His Church; but, by adding
the rules of the Order, the will of God is made
known and accomplished in all the details of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the religious is constantly occupied with the
praise, reverence and service of God. His heart is
not divided between different objects of his love: “He
that is without a wife,” says <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul, “is solicitous
for the things that belong to the Lord, how he may
please God; but he that is with a wife is solicitous
for the things of the world, how he may please his
wife; and he is divided” (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 32, 33).</p>

<p class='c007'>The condition of mind in religious is <i>like that of the
Blessed Angels</i>, who are busy with God and the things
of God. It is <i>like that of the Holy Family</i> while it
abode on earth; so that a religious house is a copy of
the Holy House of Nazareth.</p>

<p class='c007'>And all this is not to last for a little while only,
but for a whole lifetime; for the religious vows give
stability and permanence for all years to come.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore this sacrifice is compared by theologians to
<i>a holocaust</i>, the most perfect of the ancient sacrifices,
in which, namely, the whole victim was consumed in
the fire. Thus one religious is likely to do more than
a number of seculars for the praise and reverence and
service of God.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='two'>II</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'><i>And by these means the religious easily saves his
soul</i>, thus attaining the second end for which he was
created. The good Lord has promised this in so
many words. For he said: “Every one that hath left
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>house, or brethren, or sisters, or father, or mother, or
wife, or children, or lands, for my sake, shall receive
a hundred fold and shall possess life everlasting” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix</abbr>, 29).</p>

<p class='c007'>The hundred fold mentioned in this promise is not
to be passed over lightly. For although it constitutes
no portion of the eternal life of which we are speaking,
still it is intimately connected with it. For it embraces
a multitude of heavenly graces: a Divine protection
in dangers, a peace of soul that the world cannot
give; all of which make the attainment of eternal
life far more easy than it usually is outside of the
religious state.</p>

<p class='c007'>With this prospect of eternal bliss for ourselves is
united the special efficiency which the good Lord deigns
to bestow on religious to procure the salvation of many
souls. True, the exercise of the sacred ministry, with
the sacramental power, is the ordinary channel of
sanctification established by Christ in His Church; but
there is a special efficiency in personal virtue to bring
souls nearer to God; and the direct purpose and effect
of the religious life is to increase personal holiness.
The archenemy of man knows well who are the most
successful in saving souls, and those he opposes with
all his power. The fact that religious are more fiercely
hated and opposed by the enemies of God, clearly
shows that they produce more fruit in souls.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='three'>III</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'>Of course the religious life has its hardships, it is
<i>a life of sacrifice</i>; but that is its honor and its recommendation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>to a noble soul: “The kingdom of Heaven
suffereth violence, and the violent bear it away” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 12). All the Saints have led lives of sacrifice,
like their Divine Master: “Jesus said to His
disciples: If any man will come after me, let him
deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me”
(<abbr title='Ibid'>Ib.</abbr> <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 24).</p>

<p class='c007'>To aid us in carrying the cross of the religious life
cheerfully, let us reflect what <i>magnificent prizes</i> are
held out to us.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. There is the bright <i>crown of virginity</i>, with the
distinguished privilege of more intimate union with
Jesus in Heaven. “These are they who were not defiled
with women; for they are virgins. These follow
the Lamb whithersoever He goeth” (<abbr title='Apocalypse'>Apoc.</abbr> <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv</abbr>, 4).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. There is also the glory of being seated, with
Christ, on the <i>judgment seat</i>, when He will come in
His Majesty on the clouds of heaven: they are to
judge the world, rather than to be judged. Thus at
least the Venerable Bede explains the promise made by
Christ to His Apostles, which for a parity of reason,
he extends to religious: “Amen I say to you that you
who have followed me, in the regeneration, when the
Son of Man shall sit on the seat of His Majesty, you
also shall sit on twelve seats judging the twelve tribes
of Israel” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix</abbr>, 28).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Another most valuable advantage of the religious
life lies in the <i>protection</i> it affords against dangerous
temptations to sin. True, as long as we live upon
earth we may fall from grace, and forfeit, through our
own grievous fault, the rich store of merit so far
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>accumulated and our right to eternal bliss: “He that
thinketh himself to stand, let him take heed lest he
fall,” writes the Apostle (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 12). The best a
man can do is to surround himself with such securities
as lessen the assaults from without and strengthen
the will within him. And such is undoubtedly the religious
life. Its vows of poverty, chastity and obedience
cut off the fiercest assaults of man’s triple enemy,
the world, the Devil and the flesh; and its constant
practices of piety and mortification provide a copious
supply of Heavenly assistance to resist temptations.</p>

<p class='c007'>Therefore <i><abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bernard draws this consoling picture</i>
of religion: “It is a state,” he says, “in which man
lives with more purity, falls more rarely, rises more
promptly, walks more securely, is more frequently bedewed
with celestial graces, sleeps more peaceably, dies
with more assurance, passes more quickly through
Purgatory, and is more richly rewarded.”</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='four'>IV</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'>However, we must bear in mind that membership
of a religious Order does not necessarily secure all
those advantages, and that in the same Order they are
<i>obtained by different persons in very different degrees</i>.
The chief requisite to obtain them is to be a fervent
religious. The more generous one shall show himself
to God, says <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, the more generous he
shall find God towards him, and the more fit shall he
daily be to receive in greater abundance His graces
and spiritual gifts. The rapidity of our spiritual
progress is not like that of travellers in a ship on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>sea, all of whom advance at the same rate, whether
they are walking or sitting or lying down; but our
progress is like that of men travelling on a highroad,
each of whom has his own rate of advancement according
to his own efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Aloysius, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Stanislaus and <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John
Berchmans advanced further in a few months than
most religious do in many years.</p>

<p class='c007'>While we have perhaps broken strong bonds in tearing
ourselves away from home and kindred, let us not
be attached to little things; a slender silken thread is
enough to keep a bird from gaining its liberty, and thus
a little trifle may prevent us from soaring aloft to
higher regions of sanctity. God fully deserves the
love of our whole hearts, which are too small to be
divided between Him and the things of earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let us examine ourselves during this retreat, and
see whether we are drawing all the profit we should
from the rich treasury of our religious vocation.</p>
<h3 id='day1-m3' class='c011'>THE THIRD MEDITATION <br> On Indifference to Creatures</h3>
<p class='c006'>The third part of the Foundation: “<i>It is therefore
necessary that we should make ourselves indifferent to
all created things, in so far as it is left to the liberty
of our free will to do so, and is not forbidden; in such
sort that we do not for our part wish for health rather
than sickness, for wealth instead of poverty, for honor
rather than dishonor, for a long life rather than a
short one, and so in all other things, desiring and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>choosing only that which most leads us to the end for
which we were created.</i>”</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you see bright Angels standing
before the throne of God, waiting to be assigned as
guardians to new-born infants; they are perfectly indifferent
to take charge of rich or poor children in any
part of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for a like spirit of perfect indifference
to all creatures, caring for God alone and His
holy will.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr></i> Let me ask myself sincerely: am I now
fully convinced that I am in this world for no other
end than to praise, reverence and serve God, and
thereby to save my soul? that I must use creatures
only in as far as they conduce to this end? This is
right and just, it is highly useful for me; it is necessary,
the one thing necessary;—all else is vanity; it
passes away in a short time.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c013'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“The world’s a stage, and men are only players,</div>
      <div class='line'>They have their exits and their entrances.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c014'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II.</abbr></i> What prevents me from always living
up to that conviction? The reason is that I allow myself
to be influenced by various predilections and aversions,
by my likes and dislikes for certain things. If
I were perfectly indifferent, as the Angels are, whose
will has perfect control over all their affections, then
I would choose on all occasions only what God wills,
as far as His will would be known to me. Can I acquire
such an indifference? I cannot help feeling an
inclination to like or dislike certain things; for it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>an effect of the fall of man that our passions often
rebel against the spirit. But I can control these
promptings to a great extent, and with God’s grace,
acquire considerable power over their movements.</p>

<p class='c007'>To strengthen this habit of control over my various
inclinations is the purpose of the present meditation:
that is meant by making myself indifferent to all created
things.</p>

<p class='c007'>And still <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius wisely adds: “In as far as
they are allowed me and not forbidden”; lest the uninstructed
might imagine that they might lawfully allow
disorderly sentiments to arise within them without at
once driving them away.</p>

<p class='c007'>How can I make myself indifferent? By considering
the evils connected with the things to which I am
inclined, and the good to be derived from those disliked.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III.</abbr></i> Let me consider in detail some principal
objects to which a man is not naturally indifferent,
but he may with God’s grace make himself so.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>A long life or a short life.</i> For all I know, my
eternal salvation may be much better secured if I should
die soon than if I live yet many years. It was so with
many persons, who were holy in their youth and were
afterwards perverted. Therefore the Book of Wisdom
says: “He pleased God and was beloved, and
living among sinners he was translated. He was taken
away lest wickedness should alter his understanding
and deceit beguile his soul” (<abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 10, 11). What a
blessing it would have been for a Luther or a Henry
<abbr title='the eighth'>VIII</abbr> to have died young. As I do not know what is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>best for me, I ought in all reason to leave it all to God’s
disposal, and make myself indifferent to a long life or
a short life.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Health or sickness.</i> In comparison with the
salvation of my soul the enjoyment of health during
this life is of slight importance; and common sense
would bid me readily to resign the latter to secure the
former. Now God alone knows when this is necessary.
We read of a virtuous man in England, who
made a pilgrimage to the tomb of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas a’ Becket
to be cured from blindness. He was heard, and returned
rejoicing to his home. But he found soon after
that the free use of his sight led him into many new
temptations. So he returned to the same shrine and
begged the Saint that, if it were for his greater spiritual
good to be deprived of sight, this might be done
rather than that he should fall into mortal sin. The
Lord worked this second miracle to show what was
really best for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>Riches or poverty.</i> The young man whom the
Saviour invited to sell all and give to the poor and then
follow Him had not the courage to answer the call,
because he was very rich. And Jesus remarked it was
difficult for a rich man to save his soul. It is then
very wise not to care for riches, but to make one’s
self indifferent on this point.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <i>Honor rather than dishonor.</i> History is full
of examples of men who were virtuous while in an
humble station, and who, after being raised to honors,
became proud; now a proud man is odious in the sight
of God.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>5. <i>And so of all other things.</i> Let me ask myself
whether there is any point on which I am not indifferent,
and then consider how I may bend my mind in
the opposite direction; then pray earnestly to our Lord
and His Holy Mother to gain indifference to all created
things.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV.</abbr></i> Let me consider what will be the good
effects of attaining such indifference. They will be:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Considerable increase in virtue; for thus my will
becomes conformable to the will of God: I thus practise
faith in His providence, and confidence in His
paternal care of me.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Security from many dangers of sin, to which I
should have been exposed if I had persisted in controlling
my own fortunes.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Quiet of mind in the happy thought that God, to
whom I abandon myself entirely, will dispose all for
the best: “For we know that to them that love God
all things work together unto good” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii</abbr>, 28).
“Cast thy care upon the Lord, and He shall sustain
thee” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 54). “My children, behold the generations
of men, and know ye that no one hath hoped in the
Lord, and hath been confounded” (<abbr title='Ecclesiasticus'>Ecclus.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 11).</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand those who are not indifferent to
the things of earth live in constant agitation of mind,
restless in the pursuit of fancied blessings, and disappointed
when they fail to obtain them; and, what is
still worse, frequently exposed to the danger of sin,
sometimes of grievous sin, in their eagerness to obtain
their desires, or in their reluctance to do their duty.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Pray earnestly, both during the meditation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>when proper desires are aroused in your heart,
and especially at the conclusion of the meditation, that
you may totally detach your affections from all things
created, and obtain the grace of indifference to all
creatures.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>
  <h2 id='day2' class='c005'>THE SECOND DAY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>We have now fully understood the end, or purpose,
of our creation, which is to praise, reverence and serve
God and thereby save our souls. We must next consider
what will be the result if we freely refuse to live
for that end, and prefer to do our own will in opposition
to the will of God. The Lord is not going to
prevent us from doing so; He will not interfere with
the exercise of our free will. Were a child, in the
fervor of its first Communion, most earnestly to beseech
God to let it die young rather than live to commit
a mortal sin, He would no doubt give it additional
graces to avoid sin, but He will not control the child’s
freedom. Every one of us must carve out his own
future by his own free choice. We know what we
have to do to make that future sovereignly happy; and
we are now to consider prayerfully what evils threaten
us if we refuse to do it. For this purpose we will
now study certain historical facts, and see how other
persons have fared.</p>
<h3 id='day2-m1' class='c011'>FIRST MEDITATION <br> On Sin</h3>
<p class='c006'>This exercise affords a favorable opportunity to
explain the ordinary process of meditation, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>consists in applying to a chosen subject our three intellectual
faculties, the memory, the understanding and
the will, as shall now be shown in detail.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Preparatory prayer</i>, as usual.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Let me imagine I behold the scene
which Christ described saying: “I saw Satan like
lightning falling from heaven” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 18).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> I ask the grace to understand how
severely God has punished the sins of others, so that
I may conceive an intense dread and horror of sin,
especially of my own sins.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I.</abbr></i> Consider the first sin we know of, that
by which the angels fell. Apply to it: 1. The <i>memory</i>,
recalling the facts. They were created by the
same Lord that made me, and for the same end, to
praise, reverence and serve Him, and by this means to
attain eternal bliss. They, like me, were put to a
trial of their obedience; they were free to serve or no,
as they chose.</p>

<p class='c007'>A multitude of the angels refused to obey: they
sinned. These were cast out of Heaven into Hell, and
punished with the direst woe forever.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>The understanding</i> takes in the striking points
of analogy between their history and that of man:
If they were so severely punished, what must man
expect when he imitates their rebellion? What a
dreadful evil sin must be, since a good and just God
hates it so. Their great number did not save the angels,
nor will the number of bad men be a protection;
all men are like a little dust before the infinite God.
Man’s excellence is below that of the angels, in power,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>in knowledge and in all natural gifts. They sinned
but once; perhaps I have sinned repeatedly. What
must I think of myself? of my past? of my future?</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>My will</i> is gradually moved by these and similar
considerations to detest sin, to dread sin, to detest myself
if I have sinned, to beg God to spare me. I must
stir up my will to hate sin more and more, to protest
to God my hatred of it, my self-reproach: “Spare
me, Oh Lord, according to the multitude of thy mercies.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II.</abbr></i> Consider the sin of our first parents.
1. <i>My memory</i> recalls the facts. They were created
by the same God and for the same end as I; they were
loved by Him and placed in a garden of delights, in
Paradise, destined to enjoy the vision of God forever.
They were free. God allowed Satan to tempt them, as
He allows him to tempt me: “The serpent said to the
woman: No, you shall not die the death. For God
doth know that in what day soever you shall eat
thereof, your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as
gods, knowing good and evil. And the woman saw
that the tree was good, and delightful to behold: and
she took of the fruit thereof and did eat, and gave to
her husband, who did eat” (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 4-6). They
were in consequence cast out of Paradise, condemned
to more than nine hundred years of toil and suffering,
and to death, and all the evils that have befallen them
and their posterity have been the punishment of sin.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>My understanding</i> must weigh these facts and
reason on them, so as to realize the boundless evil of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>rebelling against our sovereign Lord and Master. It
is not only the words of God but even more His deeds
that show us what He is and how He acts. His severity
in punishing sin in creatures for which He had
shown such generous love exhibits the utter abomination
He has for moral evil.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. I must stir up <i>my will</i> to detest that same evil,
to dread my own weakness which exposes me to sin
again, to regret my past offenses, and to form strong
resolutions for the future, praying earnestly for God’s
help.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius bids us consider a third
sin, namely that of some person who has gone to Hell
for one mortal offense. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Liguori, in his little book
“On the Commandments and Sacraments,” narrates a
number of what he calls “Melancholic Examples,” of
persons who appeared after death, and said they were
damned for some one or more mortal sins which they
had not properly confessed. One is the case of a
woman, who had been reputed to be very devout, so
much so that after her death her body had been treated
with the greatest veneration. But the day after her
burial she appeared to the Bishop of the place as if laid
on a blazing fire, and she told him that she was damned
on account of a mortal sin of thought she had concealed
in confession.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>The memory</i> must recall the facts; it matters not
whether they are well authenticated or not, since the
doctrine is certain that one mortal sin unpardoned is
enough to damn the soul.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>2. <i>The understanding</i> reasons on the case, so as
to realize vividly the sad results of dying in sin.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>The will</i> is thus stirred up to hate sin as the
greatest of all evils, and to avoid it at any sacrifice,
according to the warning of Christ: “If thy right eye
scandalize thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee. For
it is expedient for thee that one of thy members should
perish, rather than thy whole body be cast into hell”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 29).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with Jesus dying for my sins upon the
Cross, begging for grace to repent of all past sins, and
to make strong resolutions against future offenses.</p>
<h3 id='day2-m2' class='c011'>SECOND MEDITATION <br> On One’s Own Sins</h3>
<p class='c006'>It is well to remark here that, 1. The fact that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Peter was forgiven did not prevent him from mourning
for his sin all the rest of his life; 2. Many persons
repine excessively under afflictions because they forget
that they have deserved much worse by their sins; 3.
The Saints mortified themselves severely for small
faults; 4. This meditation is congenial to humble
souls, like the Publican, but painful to the Pharisee; 5.
The least we can do is to detest our sins heartily and to
atone for them.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you stand before God like
the humble Publican, saying: “O God, have mercy on
me, a sinner.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg for an intense grief and confusion
for your sins.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Briefly recall to memory the series of
your sins, from your early years, through childhood,
boyhood, youth, through subsequent periods of your
life, noticing successive places of abode, various occupations,
companions, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Study to understand the evil of your
sins, considering:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>Every species of sin has its own peculiar vileness</i>;
for instance, lying is so odious that its very name is
offensive, stealing is still worse, so that one caught in
a theft is disgraced for life, gluttony is disgraceful,
pride is odious to God and man, envy is mean, profanity
is provoking to the great and holy God, deceit is
despicable, vanity is ridiculous, impurity lowers a man
beneath the brute, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Every sin is an insult to God.</i> When a person
insults his equal, he incurs his displeasure and deserves
punishment; more so when he insults his superior; and
the offense is the greater in proportion as the party insulted
is more distinguished and the offender lower in
comparison. Now consider how great is God, who is
insulted, compared to man, who insults Him:</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>a</abbr>. The meanness of man. What is one man compared
to a thousand men, to a thousand thousand, or
million men? Like a little gnat flitting in the sunshine.
And what are a million men compared to the one thousand
five hundred millions of men now inhabiting the
earth? And what are all these together compared to
all the former and the future generations? And what
are all men compared to the Angels of God?</p>

<p class='c007'>And what are all creatures compared to the Creator
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>Himself? Less than a drop of water compared to the
vast ocean. What then am I compared to God? And
yet, if I have ever sinned, I have put myself above God,
my will above His will. If then I have often sinned,
what punishment have I not deserved?</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>b.</abbr> See the meanness of the body of man, which
corrupts all it uses, and needs constant care to keep it
from becoming insupportable, even to itself. See how
death degrades it, how even sickness degrades it.
And the soul of man: see how it is ever inclined to
conceive and foster evil thoughts and desires, how it
prompts to evil words and actions; so that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius,
who had been a proud soldier, when he came to know
himself better, looked on himself as a running ulcer
flowing with corruption. And yet in sinning, this vile
being, man, rises up to insult God.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> On the other hand consider the greatness of God,
by comparison with the littleness of man: compare
His power with man’s weakness, His knowledge with
man’s ignorance, His eternity with man’s short span
of life, His bounty with man’s selfishness, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> I will arouse my will to detest my
sinfulness, indignant against myself, and wondering
that God continues to bear with me, to favor me, to
have His Angels protect me, the earth support me;
and He forbids all men to injure me, commands them
to love me.</p>

  <h3 id='day2-c' class='c011'>CONSIDERATION <br> On the Confession of the Retreat</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The direct purpose of the first days of the retreat
is to purify the soul of all guilt of sin and all attachment
to sin. For this purpose the Sacrament of Penance
is the most efficient means, and the confession of
sins is an integral part of the Spiritual Exercises of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Ignatius.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='one'>I</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'><i>Confession may be of three kinds</i>: a general confession
of one’s whole life, or a considerable portion of
one’s life; the ordinary, or weekly confession; and
thirdly the annual or semi-annual review, which is of
rule in many religious institutions.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>A general confession</i> is obligatory if the preceding
confessions have been badly made; it is useful at
the age when a child has been fully instructed in its
religious duties; when a person enters on a permanent
state of life, and perhaps once more, when one approaches
the portals of eternity. The anxiety entertained
by some souls to repeat their general confessions
over and over again is most unreasonable; it fosters
scrupulosity and is injurious to spiritual progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>In the ordinary, or weekly, confessions</i>, which,
in the case of religious, rarely include a mortal sin,
earnest care must be taken that one or more real sins,
recently or formerly committed, be confessed, so that
matter be presented for absolution; and also that there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>be elicited an act of supernatural contrition for those
sins, or at least for some one of them. Else the Sacrament
would be invalid, for real supernatural contrition
is one of its essential parts.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>An annual or semi-annual review</i> of the weekly
confessions affords marked advantages, especially
when it is made during the retreat: a. Faults are
thus likely to be noticed which attracted little attention
at other times. As when a ray of sunshine enters into
a rather dark room, and reveals more dust on the
furniture than was noticed before, so the Divine light
of grace, entering the soul during the Exercises, discovers
various defects of which there had been no clear
perception. That is a good occasion to obtain pardon
for them.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>b.</abbr> When our faults are thus seen together, they are
apt to arouse more contrition, and thus secure more
entire pardon.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> Such a review gives us a clearer knowledge of
ourselves and shows us what defects we should chiefly
labor to correct.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='two'>II</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'><i>To prepare for such a review</i>, we should consider
those sins especially which are more likely to be committed
by religious. In mentioning them we shall follow
the order of the Decalogue.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The First Commandment</i> regards the worship of
God. Under this head come wilful distractions or
negligences in prayer, which may spoil considerable
parts of our spiritual exercises; disrespectful handling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>of holy things, and the unworthy reception of the
Sacraments. This last sin is of course rare among religious,
but very grievous if it should occur; for it
bears the guilt of sacrilege.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Second Commandment</i> requires the observance
of our vows. The vow of poverty is violated when a
religious disposes of any temporal goods without permission
of his superior, acting as if it were his own
property. That of chastity attaches to the violation of
the sixth and ninth commandments the additional guilt
of sacrilege. The vow of obedience is violated when a
religious refuses or neglects to do what he is commanded
to do under obedience, or does what he is
thus forbidden.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Third Commandment</i> is not likely to be violated
by religious.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Fourth Commandment</i> obliges subjects to reverence
and obey their superiors when they mean to impose
an obligation of conscience; and they must be
supposed to mean it when the good of souls or the
glory of God requires them thus to use their authority.
A precept of obedience in virtue of the vow is rarely
imposed; but commands in matters of some importance
derive from the natural law power to oblige any subjects
to obey their lawful superiors, independently of
any vow. If serious consequences are likely to follow
from the violation of the command, the sin may be
grievous.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Fifth Commandment</i> says: “Thou shalt not
kill,” and forbids all wilful injury to another’s or to
one’s own body. Of course religious are not likely to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>injure others violently; but this commandment may be
violated in many other ways. One may neglect his
own health or injure it by indiscretion in the use of
food and drink, thus bringing on diseases by which
many a life is shortened. A superior or an infirmarian
may neglect the proper care of sick or delicate persons,
a pastor or teacher that of school children, etc. Injury
done to the souls of others by scandal, or bad example,
may also be considered under this commandment; and
there are very many ways of giving scandal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Fifth Commandment also forbids quarrelling,
unreasonable anger, hatred and revenge. A religious
teacher, for instance, must be careful that, when obliged
to punish children, he does not allow himself to be
prompted by passion; and revenge is totally opposed
to the spirit of Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Sixth Commandment</i> forbids any act of impurity
wilfully committed; and it has this peculiarity
that it admits of no slight matter, but the sin is always
grievous when the impure pleasure is sought or admitted
with full knowledge and full consent.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Seventh Commandment</i> forbids stealing and all
injustice done to others in their material possessions.
The religious state is a strong protection against these
sins; still it does not make them impossible. It may
happen that a religious does not fulfill all the conditions
of a contract; as for instance, when a teacher neglects
his class or some of his pupils, so that these do not
really get the value of the tuition charges.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Eighth Commandment</i> enjoins both truthfulness
and regard for another’s good name. A lie is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>never allowed, and mental reservations must not be
used but for good reasons, lest human intercourse lose
the charm and security of mutual confidence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any lessening of another’s good name without sufficient
reason is sinful, and it is doubly so when the
accusation is false; even a rash judgment or suspicion
is wrong, yet it may be mistaken without being rash.
The great rule is: “See thou never do to another what
thou wouldst hate to have done to thee by another”
(<abbr title='Tobit'>Tob.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 16).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Ninth and Tenth Commandments</i> forbid sinful
thoughts and desires in matters forbidden by the Sixth
and Seventh Commandments. On this point <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius
remarks that when an evil thought is promptly
dismissed, there is merit, not sin; and if it returns
again and again and is always resisted, there is more
and more merit. But a venial sin is committed when
one listens to the evil suggestion so as to dwell a little
on it, or to admit some carnal delight, or to be somewhat
negligent in rejecting it. A grievous sin supposes
that the thought or desire is fully consented
to.</p>
<h3 id='day2-m3' class='c011'>THE THIRD MEDITATION <br> On Eternal Loss</h3>
<p class='c006'><i>Remarks</i>: The purpose of the first days of the
Exercises being to inspire an intense and lasting hatred
of sin, it is highly proper that we should meditate on
the principal punishment of sin, the eternal loss of the
soul, the pains of Hell. Many Saints have been led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>to Heaven by the road of fear, some religious Orders
acknowledge this as their chief spirit. No one can
afford to do without the fear of God; we should all
nourish it; so that, if ever our love of God should be
too weak to keep us from sin, the fear of Hell may
restrain us. We descend into that abyss in thought
at present, that we may not hereafter be cast into it
in reality.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you see in the center of the
earth a vast ocean of fire, in which are plunged countless
souls condemned to eternal punishment.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg earnestly from your Sovereign
Lord for an intense and abiding fear of those awful
sufferings and for a firm purpose of never sinning
again.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Recall to memory what we know of
Hell; in particular:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. That its existence and its dreadful nature are as
clearly revealed in Holy Writ as any truth whatever.
For instance, Christ said: “If thy eye scandalize thee,
pluck it out. It is better for thee with one eye to enter
into the kingdom of God, than having two eyes to be
cast into the hell of fire; where their worm dieth not,
and the fire is not extinguished. For every one shall
be salted with fire” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark <abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>, 46, 48). Then
there is the parable of Dives and Lazarus (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke,
<abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 19-31).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. That Hell awaits all those who die in mortal sin,
whatever they may have been in life, religious or seculars,
bishops or priests.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. That vast multitudes go there: “Broad is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>way that leadeth to destruction, and many there are
who go in thereat” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 13).</p>

<p class='c007'>Many who were supposed to be holy. See <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Liguori, “Melancholy Examples.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Many who had begun well, as Judas had.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. That I am in danger, as long as I live, of
sinning mortally, of dying in sin and losing my soul.
Perhaps some are in Hell through my fault.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>What are the sufferings of the body in
Hell</i>?</p>

<p class='c007'>All the senses will be tormented, as for their gratification
God has been offended. Chiefly the sense of
touch, and that by the horrible torture of fire: “Depart
from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv</abbr>, 41), “Which of you can dwell with everlasting
burnings?” (<abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii</abbr>, 14).</p>

<p class='c007'>God showed <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa in a vision the place the
Devil had prepared for her in Hell. She narrates it
thus: “I was one day in prayer, when I found myself
in a moment, without knowing how, plunged apparently
into Hell. I understood that it was our Lord’s
will that I should see the place which the devils kept
in readiness for me, and which I had deserved by my
sins. It was but a moment, but it seems to me impossible
that I should ever forget it, if I were to live
many years. The entrance seemed to be by a long and
narrow pass, like a furnace, very low, dark and close.
The ground seemed to be saturated with water, mere
mud, exceedingly foul, sending forth pestilential odors
and covered with loathsome vermin. At the end was
a hollow place in the wall, like a closet, and in that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>saw myself confined. All this was even pleasant to
behold in comparison with what I felt there” (Coleridge,
“Life of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Teresa,” <abbr title='volume'>Vol.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 133). “She
says,” Father Coleridge adds, “she cannot describe
what she felt. There was a fire in her soul. She suffered
unendurably in her body. All that she had suffered
in diseases, or in what Satan had been allowed to
inflict upon her, was as nothing in comparison; and
she saw there was to be no intermission, no end to the
pain. But the pains of the body were as nothing to
the pains of the soul. She describes the anguish as a
sense of oppression and stifling in the soul, all the while
tearing itself to pieces with remorse and despair.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>What are the sufferings of the soul?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>The memory</i> will recall the abundance of graces,
by which salvation could so easily have been secured;
the example of companions who were innocent or sincerely
penitent, who are now in Heaven; the soul’s own
goodness and happiness at the time of its first Communion
and at other periods of its life.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>The understanding</i> will then fully realize that
one thing alone was necessary while on earth, that life
was given to work out salvation, that all the rest was
vanity, that all illusions are now dispelled, and there
is no happiness to be found by the creature except in
God; there is only total disappointment, absolute loss
of all satisfaction; and this pain of disappointed love
will then be greater than all the other sufferings.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>The will</i> then will desire only God, for the love
and possession of whom all its nature longs, because
it was made for Him alone. Therefore the soul will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>hate its own perverseness with a sovereign hatred, and
curse itself in its absolute despair.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The soul will always have present to its mind
<i>the awful sentence</i> pronounced by the Supreme Judge:
“Depart from me into eternal fire.” “Eternal”:
What, in comparison, are days, or nights, or months,
or years of suffering? Ever in pain, ever in despair;
no end, no hope of an end or of any mitigation.</p>

  <h2 id='day3' class='c005'>THE THIRD DAY</h2>
</div>
<h3 id='day3-m1' class='c011'>THE FIRST MEDITATION <br> A Preparation for Death</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> A captain of infantry had been ordered
by his general to lead his company at the first
dawn of light the next morning up a neighboring hill
where the enemy had just planted a masked battery.
To spend the intervening night he had a log cabin
allotted him. He felt it was a dangerous task assigned
him, as he was likely to be shot while ascending the hill
at the head of his men. Yet he faltered not, for he
was brave. But before lying down to rest, he lit a
candle, pulled out his prayer book, and knelt down to
prepare himself for a good death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Imagine that God gives you the present hour to prepare
for your own approaching death.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> O Lord: give me the grace of making
to-day a thoroughly good preparation for death.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>It is absolutely certain that I shall die</i>,
it is only a matter of more or less delay; “It is appointed
unto men once to die” (<abbr title='Hebrews'>Hebr.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>, 27). “Dust
thou art and into dust thou shalt return” is the sentence
pronounced on me, as on all men. No sensible
man doubts this, yet many try to forget it, and live
as if the sentence were not for them. O my Lord God!
I will not be so foolish; and I accept with humility the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>sentence of death. I have deserved it, and I will
suffer it in punishment and expiation of my sins.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>All the circumstances of my death are
very uncertain.</i> 1. <i>The time.</i> No one but God can
assure me of another day of life. Many are at this
moment in vigorous health who will be dead to-morrow.
I may be one of them: “If thou shalt not
watch, I will come to thee as a thief, and thou shalt not
know at what hour I shall come to thee” (<abbr title='Apocalypse'>Apoc.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 3).
A thief comes when least expected. Many are sick
for a time and yet expire suddenly before they realize
their danger. Even many of the Saints were called
away in the middle of their most important careers:
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis Xavier when on the point of entering
China, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas Aquinas before he could finish his
Summa of Universal Theology, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Bonaventure during
the General Council of Lyons, etc. Am I ready?
Was I ready at any hour of last year?</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>The place</i> may be anywhere; we cannot find a
spot secure against the shafts of death.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>The manner</i>; It may be sudden, whether from a
latent disease which we never suspected, or from any of
the multitudinous accidents so common in the modern
rush of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Or it may be preceded by weeks of suffering in an
unconscious or semi-conscious condition. Even when
the danger is known to others, it is often hidden from
the patient. My Lord God! I humbly submit beforehand
to all the circumstances Thou hast determined
shall attend my death, to all its physical and mental
sufferings, to its sudden stroke or lingering approach.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Only grant me the grace of being well disposed when
it shall arrive. Make known to me, I pray, what sacrifices
I must make that I may be well prepared.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>What shall be my sentiments when
death is nigh?</i> Some rejoice at its approach; like <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Paul, they wish to be dissolved and to be with Christ.
Many are horrified when it comes, and wish in vain
that they could live their lives all over again. Now
is the time to prepare, then it will be too late. Many
again, even good Christians and religious, would then
wish to make some more or less important changes
before expiring. Now is the time to make them.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have seen a novice dying most joyously, with these
words on his lips: “I know I am going to Heaven.”
I have seen a religious priest, who had led a pious and
zealous life, bursting into tears on his deathbed, explaining
that he now realized how much more he could
have done for God and the good of souls, and how
bitterly he regretted his former negligences. And yet
he was a model pastor of souls. What shall be my
sentiments?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with Jesus and Mary, begging earnestly to
know now what is still wanting to me, that I may
provide in good time; “O Lord! make me know my end—that
I may know what is wanting to me!” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 38).</p>
<h3 id='day3-m2' class='c011'>THE SECOND MEDITATION <br> On the Particular Judgment</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine that your soul has left your
body and is now to be judged by Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask earnestly that you may understand
all things now as you shall then, and that you
may act accordingly.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>Consider when that judgment will take
place</i>: “It is appointed unto men once to die, and,
after this, the judgment” (<abbr title='Hebrews'>Hebr.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>, 27). Human
tribunals delay trials to take evidence; not so God.
One moment we may be sinning or meriting, the next
moment we are judged for it. No warning is given
beforehand, as for a college examination. The rich
man of whom Christ said that he was going to build
new barns, saying to his soul: “Soul, thou hast much
goods laid up for many years; take thy rest, eat, drink,
make good cheer,” was rebuked by the Lord, saying:
“Thou fool, this night they will require thy soul from
thee” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>, 16-20).</p>

<p class='c007'>Be ever ready. Make frequent acts of perfect contrition.
Make every confession as if it were to be the
last of your life.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>Consider the persons present</i>: 1.
<i>The soul</i>; Father Gaudier, <abbr class='spell'>S. J.</abbr>, describes it thus: “It
receives a novel manner of knowing, without the body,
by which its entire life is represented to it at a glance.
It thoroughly understands what is the nature of created
things, its own present condition and the new
aspect of things; and it sees itself naked, solitary and
deserted by all, with nothing but its good and bad
works, in the presence of its Judge. Hence arises a
very different view of its own concerns and all created
and external things from what it had before. Besides,
its will is changed; for all love of created goods is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>vanished, and in its stead there is a most powerful
impulse towards God as its last end. This tendency,
now that the hindrance of the body is removed, urges
it most forcibly to this union” (Introd. ad Solid. Perfect.,
<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 196).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Christ</i> is now manifested to the soul. He is the
God who condemned to eternal woe the rebel angels,
Judas, and all who are in Hell, and who has rewarded
all the Saints with eternal bliss. As man, He is now
going to examine what fruit the soul now before Him
has produced. No other parties can well be expected
to be present, except, perhaps the Guardian Angel and
an evil spirit, ready to execute the sentence.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>Consider the account to be rendered</i>,
of every thought, word, action and omission from the
first dawn of reason till the last breath. Even good
works may contain many imperfections, as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul
explains by this comparison. “Other foundation no
man can lay but that which is laid, which is Christ
Jesus. Now if any man build upon this foundation
gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble, every
man’s work shall be manifest; for the day of the Lord
shall declare it, because it shall be revealed in fire; and
the fire shall try every man’s work, of what sort it is”
(<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 11-16).</p>

<p class='c007'>The examination will embrace all the Commandments
of God and of the Church, the duties of one’s
state of life, the proper use of one’s talents, one’s opportunities,
etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>a.</abbr> There are <i>two consoling thoughts</i> in this matter.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>1. The religious vows probably act as a second
Baptism, cancelling all former debts. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas attributes
this effect to the perfect dispositions of the
person making them. If this is the reason, then it
would seem that the renewal of vows may have the
same effect, whenever it is made with equally good
dispositions.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Whatever has once been forgiven remains forgiven.
Merit when lost may return, but forgiven sins
do not return.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr class='spell'>b.</abbr> Yet there are <i>two classes of sins that may well
cause anxiety</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Those of which we have never truly repented,
perhaps because we were too proud to admit we were
to blame, and laid the blame on others instead.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Those sins which we have very often confessed,
but which we have made no serious efforts to avoid in
future, perhaps because we had no real contrition for
them.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>.</i> <i>The sentence</i> will be just what is deserved;
for a judgment is not an act of mercy, but of
the intellect seeing the truth of things and pronouncing
accordingly: “I will judge thee according to thy
ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy crimes. My eye
shall not spare, neither will I show mercy” (<abbr title='Ezechiel'>Ezech.</abbr>
<abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 8, 9). “Then will he (the Son of man) render to
every man according to his works” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>,
27).</p>

<p class='c007'>If a mortal sin be there, all is lost: “If a just man
shall turn away from his justice and shall commit
iniquity—he shall die in his sin, and his justices which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>he hath done shall not be remembered” (<abbr title='Ezechiel'>Ezech.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 20).</p>

<p class='c007'>The sentence will be final, because there is no appeal
to a higher tribunal, and we can no longer merit a
change: “The night cometh when no man can work”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>, 4).</p>

<p class='c007'>The sufferings of Purgatory come to an end, but
merit neglected to be acquired can never more be
gained.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may well exclaim with <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Magdalene de Pazzi:
“It is a terrible thing to have to stand before the judgment
seat of God.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Ask to understand all things now as you
shall realize them at the judgment.</p>
<h3 id='day3-c' class='c011'>CONSIDERATION <br> On Purity of Conscience</h3>
<p class='c006'>The main purpose of the first part of the Spiritual
Exercises, or what <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius calls the first week,
is to purify the soul from all stains of sin, and to
strengthen it against all temptations to sin in future.
Of course mortal sin is the principal evil to be destroyed,
it is the greatest evil in the world. Since the
religious life is essentially the way of perfection, it
presupposes the destruction of mortal sin; being the
way of the counsels, it supposes the observance of the
Commandments.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet it is quite proper that religious in their yearly
retreats should review the Exercises of the first week,
the meditations regarding mortal sins and the fear of
the Lord, not so much to obtain pardon of sins committed,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>as to strengthen their resolutions and to take
precaution against committing sins in the future. In
fact, as a rule, religious do not commit mortal sins;
and, although they must be constantly on their guard
against temptations,—because, while the spirit is willing,
the flesh is weak,—yet it is a consoling truth that
they rarely fall so low. A religious that frequently
commits mortal sins lives far below the normal standard
of his state of life. He is indeed greatly to be
pitied, and is in serious danger of becoming a reprobate.
Of course no one should ever be discouraged,
but such a person should arouse himself to fervent
prayer and vigorous exertions; he is walking on the
brink of the precipice.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whoever has come to the present part of the Spiritual
Exercises is supposed to have conceived an intense
horror of mortal sin. But we ought not to be satisfied
with attaining this first degree of purity of conscience;
we ought to strive seriously to attain the second degree,
or to confirm ourselves in the same; that is, we ought
also carefully to avoid the commission of all deliberate
venial sins. We must distinguish between two kinds
of venial sins, the deliberate and the indeliberate.
Both kinds suppose that, while committing them, we
are aware that we are doing something which God
forbids, or omitting what He commands; else we do
not really displease Him. But the sin is deliberate
when we fully notice the evil, and do it nevertheless
with full consent of our free will; else it may be called
indeliberate. Indeliberate sins will escape from time to
time even very virtuous persons, owing to our unruly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>passions and the weakness of the human will in consequence
of Adam’s sin and of evil habits.</p>

<p class='c007'>Each of such faults, singly considered, could be
avoided; for whatever cannot be avoided at all cannot
be laid to our blame; but all cannot be avoided together.
Thus a beginner may be able to pronounce correctly
every word on a page of his reader, but will not proceed
far without making some mistakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>So we cannot avoid all indeliberate venial sins a
long time together, unless God give us an extraordinary
grace to do so.</p>

<p class='c007'>But with the ordinary grace of God a virtuous person
may avoid all deliberate venial sins. For this purpose
we must first of all convince ourselves of the great evil
contained in every wilful offense of God; for by such
offense a poor mortal puts his will above the will of his
Creator and Lord. This evil is so great that no creature,
nor even all creatures united, could by their own
power fully atone for it.</p>

<p class='c007'>This becomes more evident when we consider some
examples of the severe punishments inflicted by the
Lord on those guilty of such offences. Thus when
King David had committed an act of vanity by ordering
an enumeration of all his subjects to see how great
a monarch he had become, which seems to have been
only a venial sin, the Lord sent to him the prophet Gad,
to give him the choice between three punishments,
namely three years of famine, three months of flight
before his enemies or three days of pestilence on his
people. He chose the pestilence, and it carried off
seventy thousand men (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Paralipomenon'>Paral.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi</abbr>).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Moses for a venial fault was refused the honor of
leading the Chosen People into the promised land,
which would have been a fitting crown of all his labors.
His sister Mary, for some murmuring against her
brother, was stricken with a leprosy and humiliated before
all the people. In fact, leprosy is a striking figure
of the effect of venial sin on the soul; for it disfigures
the soul without depriving it of life. If a visible
leprosy were usually the effect of wilful venial sin,
men would be as anxious to avoid such an evil as they
are now to escape that bodily plague.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then there are the pains of Purgatory to be considered,
which are deserved by venial sins; they are worse
than any pain known to us in this life. For, as
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas remarks, they are different in kind: the
fire of Purgatory is not created for the service and
comfort of man, but for his punishment and torture.
The examples of its duration which have been made
known by revelations to saintly souls are proofs of
the terrible evil such offences are in the sight of the
just, all-holy God. Father Faber, in his “All for
Jesus” says: “In the revelations of Sister Frances
of Pampeluna, we find that, among some hundreds
of cases, by far the greater majority suffered 30, 40
or 60 years” (<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 394, 395).</p>

<p class='c007'>There results besides from venial sins a still worse
consequence than any transitory suffering, namely that
they expose us to the danger of committing mortal sins
and losing our soul for eternity. This happens in two
ways, naturally and supernaturally.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. It is <i>natural</i> for man, when he does a good or a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>bad act, to become thereby more inclined to do the same
again under similar influences and circumstances; thus
habits are contracted of virtue and vice. The commission
of venial sins therefore inclines the soul to sin
more readily thereafter, and to sin, not only oftener,
but also more grievously; and thus venial often lead
to mortal sins. This is not theory only, but the teaching
of constant experience. For instance, a religious
has acquired great purity of conscience, he is a model
of modesty; but he begins to neglect his rules, he gets
accustomed to glance rather freely at indelicate objects,
he becomes habituated to indulge his curiosity. Still
he would shrink from anything impure. But his imagination
becomes more indelicate, his passions less
restrained, wilful venial sins multiply and grievous
falls may follow sooner than he expected. Mortal
sins themselves may become habitual, and who can tell
where the evil will end? Even if only one mortal sin
were thus brought about, the evil is the greatest of misfortunes.
But this growing habit is likely to get still
worse.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Supernaturally</i> a similar process is going on.
By every act of virtue we obtain, along with the merit,
additional actual grace to merit more; but when we
sin, we fail to obtain this new accession of grace; and
thus it becomes less likely that we shall do better next
time. We may thus lose more and more grace by repeated
venial faults; and in face of an unusually strong
temptation, we may be so weak as to yield assent. No
one becomes very bad on a sudden; but many gradually
lose their virtue and become reprobates. History
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>is full of such examples, and daily experience ought to
be a constant warning against such danger.</p>

<p class='c007'>But even if there were no danger of mortal sin
(which is, of course, a false supposition) a religious
has a special reason to avoid all deliberate sin in the
fact that he has been made a favorite disciple of the
Blessed Saviour. When he wantonly offends the
Lord, he deserves to some extent the reproach originally
addressed to the Chosen People, and afterwards
applied to Judas: “If my enemy had reviled me, I
would verily have borne with it. And if he that hated
me had spoken great things against me, I would perhaps
have hidden myself from him. But thou a man
of one mind, my guide and my familiar, who didst
take sweetmeats together with me; in the house of the
Lord we walked with consent” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 54). We would
not willingly grieve or insult a friend; and is not Jesus
our dearest and most devoted friend? Certainly it
ought to be one of the principal resolutions of the retreat
to strive earnestly and unceasingly to avoid all
deliberate sins.</p>
<h3 id='day3-m3' class='c011'>THE THIRD MEDITATION <br> To Excite Perfect Contrition</h3>
<p class='c006'>It is highly proper that we should not conclude this
first part of the retreat without striving earnestly to
arouse within our hearts a deep sorrow for all our sins,
and that for the most perfect of motives, namely because
by them we have offended God, who is infinitely
good in Himself and infinitely bountiful to us. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>this purpose we are going to spend this hour of meditation
in considering various manifestations of the
Divine goodness.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you behold the return of the
Prodigal Son, whom his aged father clasps most affectionately
to his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask earnestly for an intense love of
God and a perfect contrition for all your sins.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider the parable of the Prodigal
Son, in which the Lord Jesus Himself has given us a
most striking picture of the goodness of our Heavenly
Father. We may read to advantage the whole parable
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 11, etc.), but chiefly <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 20-24:
“And rising up he came to his father. And when he
was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and was
moved with compassion; and running to him fell
upon his neck and kissed him. And the son said to
him: Father, I have sinned against heaven and before
thee, I am not now worthy to be called thy son.
And the father said to his servants: Bring forth
quickly the first robe, and put it on him, and put a ring
on his hand, and shoes on his feet. And bring hither
the fatted calf, and kill it, and let us eat and make
merry; because this my son was dead and is come to
life again, was lost and is found; and they began to
make merry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not a word of reproach, no limit to the pardon, only
expressions of happiness, and solicitude to restore the
boy’s honor. Thus does God act with sincere penitents.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> As the feast prepared is to-morrow’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>Holy Communion, we will consider in the next place
how Christ <i>prepared</i> His Apostles for their Communion.
“Before the festival day of the Pasch, Jesus
knowing that his hour was come, and that he should
pass out of this world to the Father, having loved his
own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And when supper was done—he rises from supper,
and layeth aside his garments and having taken a
towel, girdeth himself, etc.” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>, 1-5).</p>

<p class='c007'>The washing of the feet is the image of the Sacrament
of Penance, in which Christ washes away our sins
in His sacred blood. What a wonderful invention of
His infinite love: And how we ought to love Him, in
return, instead of offending Him by sin. Elicit an act
of contrition.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> Consider that other manifestation of
Divine love, the institution of the Blessed Sacrament:
“Whilst they were at supper Jesus took bread, and
blessed, and broke, and gave to his disciples, and said:
Take ye and eat, this is my body. And taking the
chalice, he gave thanks, and gave to them saying:
Drink ye all of this. For this is my blood of the
new testament, which shall be shed for many unto the
remission of sins” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi</abbr>, 26-28).</p>

<p class='c007'>Could we conceive any greater love than that Christ
should feed us with His own sacred body and blood?
And yet, when we sin, we turn against Him, as when
a serpent bites its benefactor who warms it in his
bosom. My God, pardon me! My God, I love Thee
above all things! I am most sorry for having offended
Thee!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>A consoling fact like the following may give us a
more sensible appreciation of the favor granted us in
the reception of Holy Communion. On All Saints
Day, 1612, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Alphonsus Rodriguez had received the
Blessed Sacrament with his brethren, when the good
Lord showed him in a sensible manner His presence in
the hearts of all those who had just communicated, so
that he beheld the Saviour resplendent with glory,
whole and entire in each of the religious (Life of <abbr title='Blessed'>Bl.</abbr>
<abbr title='Alphonsus'>Alph.</abbr> <abbr title='Rodriguez'>Rodr.</abbr> by a Lay-brother, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 82).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>.</i> Imagine you visit a church or chapel
at midnight. Jesus Christ is there then, as at every
hour of night and day. He is praying for you to His
Heavenly Father, because he loves you, and He knows
you need abundant graces to lead a worthy life. It
was when Blessed Margaret Mary was adoring Him in
her convent chapel that Jesus appeared to her on the
altar pointing to His Sacred Heart, and saying: “Behold
the Heart that has loved man so much, and I receive
nothing but coldness in return.” He longs for
love; and certainly we did not love Him when we
sinned. O my Jesus! I wish to love Thee. I detest
my sins.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with our dear Lord, protesting to Him that
I love Him sincerely with my whole heart and soul,
that I am most heartily sorry for having offended Him,
because He is infinitely amiable, begging that I may
love Him more and more.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>
  <h2 id='day4' class='c005'>THE FOURTH DAY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Now that we have freed our souls from every sinful
affection, Christ comes to offer Himself to lead us on,
that by following Him we may establish the Kingdom
of God in our own souls and in the souls of others.
The study of the end of man was the foundation of a
good life, the study of the following of Christ is the
foundation of a perfect life.</p>
<h3 id='day4-m1' class='c011'>FIRST MEDITATION <br> The Kingdom of Christ</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you see Christ going from
town to town, announcing the Kingdom of His Father.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for grace to understand the call
and to follow Him with a generous heart.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider this parable: God has chosen
a most noble Catholic prince, endowed with all the virtues
that conciliate the esteem and love of every good
and brave man; and He has appointed him to put down
all the enemies of Christ, to establish the Kingdom of
God in all countries, and make the Lord reign supreme
over all mankind. He is the greatest of heroes, accomplished
in person, magnetic in influence, beyond
any mortal that has ever appeared on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>This King issues a call to all Catholic warriors (for
in this parable only warriors are spoken of) inviting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>them to rally under his standard. They are going to
fight for the grandest, holiest and dearest of all causes.
He promises them certain victory, no one of his followers
shall perish unless it be through his own fault.
Yet it will be a strenuous campaign, full of hardships
and fatigue for all concerned. But the King himself
will ever be in the midst of his soldiers, in the thickest
of the fight, sharing in their hardships and privations,
so that no one will be expected to toil and endure more
than the leader; and each one shall share in the victory
in proportion to the sacrifices he shall have made in the
holy cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>What should a brave warrior answer to such an appeal?
The promises may appear to be excessive, impossible;
but they are so in the parable only, not in
the real facts figured by it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Now consider the application to the
reality signified. The Son of God Himself is that
King, nobler and grander than any mere human genius
or hero, who has truly come into this world to establish
the Kingdom of God, and who is accomplishing this
appointed task.</p>

<p class='c007'>He calls upon all men, women and children to follow
Him in His contest against God’s enemies; not that He
needs their aid, but that they may share in the glory
of the victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>For this purpose all must, in some measure, share
His labors and His sacrifices; but He will ever be by
their side, and endure more than any of them. Every
one will share in the magnificent rewards in proportion
to his generous exertions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>What answer should every generous heart make to
such an appeal from his great, good God, his sovereign
Lord and Saviour? “To-day, if you shall hear his
voice, harden not your hearts” exclaims the Psalmist
(<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 94).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> Those who wish to show greater affection,
and to signalize themselves in the King’s service,
not only will offer their whole persons to labor,
but will also act against their own sensuality, and say:
“Eternal Lord of all things, I make my oblation with
Thy favor and help, in the presence of Thine infinite
goodness, and in the sight of Thy glorious Mother,
and of all the Angels of Thine Heavenly court, protesting
that I wish and desire, and that it is my deliberate
determination (provided only it be for Thy greater
service and praise) to imitate Thee in bearing all insults
and reproaches, and all poverty, as well actual
poverty as poverty of spirit, if only Thy Divine Majesty
be pleased to choose and receive me to this life
and state.” As Jesuits, we are certainly called to this
close imitation of Christ. We must, not only faithfully
resist all temptations to sin, but also generously
follow our King in sacrificing lawful pleasures, trampling
upon worldly honors, upon self-esteem and bodily
comforts, leading mortified lives, as worthy companions
of Jesus.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>.</i> That war against Satan and against
human depravity has been going on for nineteen centuries.
Millions have been following Christ to victory,
and are now reigning with Him in Heaven. Our time
is come; we too must make our choice. Our King has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>said: “He who is not with me is against me,” “No
man can serve two masters” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 24). Let
us offer ourselves to be the generous and faithful followers
of our Blessed Saviour, imitating Him on earth
that we may follow Him into the glory of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>What sacrifices in particular can I offer Him?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Beg earnestly for light and grace to understand
and follow the example of Christ.</p>
<h3 id='day4-m2' class='c011'>SECOND MEDITATION <br> On the Incarnation</h3>
<p class='c006'>Here <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius begins what he calls the Second
Week of his Exercises, in which he bids us study how
the great King leads us in the grand enterprise of establishing
the Kingdom of His Father, by considering
His coming on earth, His nativity, His childhood and
His private life. The main purpose all along is to
make us know Him more intimately, love Him more
ardently and follow Him more faithfully. This following
consists in making ourselves more and more like
to Him: “Whom he (God) foreknew he also predestinated
to be made comformable to the image of his
Son” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii</abbr>, 29). By this conformity to Christ
we make God reign in our hearts and prepare ourselves
to enter into His Heavenly Kingdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this and the following exercises a change is made
in the process so far followed; namely, instead of recalling
the facts to memory in the body of the meditation,
we now recall them in a special prelude, put before
the two usual ones. Then in the points we do less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>reasoning; we rather look on and behold the event as
it were passing before our eyes, noticing in particular
the persons, their words and their actions, and dwelling
on the thoughts and the sentiments which they suggest
to our minds. From the fact that we behold rather
than reason, these exercises are usually called <i>contemplations</i>,
rather than <i>meditations</i>, though the name
is of little importance, provided the process be well understood.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Recall the facts to mind, as they are
related by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke (<abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 26-38).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you see the face of the earth,
as it was at that time, inhabited by diverse races of
men, civilized and barbarian, all steeped in vice and
rushing on, a vast torrent, into the abyss of Hell. In
the little town of Nazareth the Virgin Mary at prayer,
and God the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost looking
down from Heaven upon the varied scene.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg fervently that you may understand
this mystery, and may learn from it to know
your King, Christ, more clearly, love Him more ardently
and follow Him more faithfully.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>Study the scene</i> as it was before the
descent of the Angel, noticing the persons, with their
words and actions.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>The human race</i>, in a great variety of conditions:
some rich, others poor; some learned, others
ignorant; some refined, others rude; some suffering,
others rejoicing; talking of wars and of pleasure, adoring
idols; but nearly all rushing on, like a vast torrent,
into Hell.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>2. Then consider the <i>chaste Virgin Mary</i>, praying
for the coming of the Messias, lowering herself in her
own mind, thinking of her littleness before God. Thus
the poet tells of a drop of water saying to itself:
“how little I am in the vast ocean around me;” and
at that moment a shellfish swallowed the drop, and it
lay hardening in the shell, and it became the choicest
pearl that ever shone on a queenly diadem. So was
Mary chosen in her humility.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Consider the <i>three Divine Persons</i> looking down
from Heaven upon the scene below, seeing the mass of
moral corruption, yet, instead of sending down avenging
fire or a new deluge of water to punish the guilty
race, pitying its sad condition. The Son of God steps
down from His throne, and casts Himself at the feet
of His Heavenly Father, offering Himself to assume
our mortal nature and to atone for our sins.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here is the first step of our King, lowering Himself:
<span lang="la"><i>Exinanivit semetipsum</i></span>: “He emptied himself, taking
the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of
men, and in habit found as a man” (<abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 7). We
are to imitate Him, to be made like to Him. This is
our first lesson; let us learn it well: we must be humble.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> The Angel Gabriel is sent to Mary to
announce her selection as the Mother of God. He
comes, not to the mighty city of Rome, to its gilt palaces
and learned scholars; the things of earth are very
small in the sight of God. He comes to an unknown
little town in a despised country, to a poor maiden, unknown
to the world.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Listen to the words spoken</i>: “Hail, full of grace,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>the Lord is with thee, blessed art thou among women.”
Mary is too humble to realize that such words could
be suitable to her: “She was troubled at his saying.”
But the Angel explains and dispels her fear. He adds:
“Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and shalt bring
forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus. He
shall be great and shall be called the Son of the most
High.” Now her Virgin heart is alarmed; so precious
is the jewel of virginity in her sight. “How shall this
be done, because I know not man? And the Angel
answering said to her: The Holy Ghost shall come
upon thee, and the power of the most High shall overshadow
thee. And therefore also the Holy which shall
be born of thee shall be called the Son of God.” Thus
reassured, she understands that such is the will of God;
her answer beautifully expresses her humility: “Behold
the handmaid of the Lord, be it done to me according
to thy word.” She does not say: behold then
the future queen of Heaven and earth, but the handmaid
of the Lord. Jesus has associated her with Himself
making her, here and all through life, the model
of every virtue.</p>

<p class='c007'>Her example is like that of the Redeemer: humility,
humility.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> After her consent had thus been expressed,
God, who always respects the free will of
men, formed in her womb, from her virgin blood, the
body of her Divine Son: “And the Word was made
flesh and dwelt among us” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 14). As when
he formed the body of Adam out of the slime of the
earth, He breathed into his face the breath of life; so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>now He created the soul of Christ, and united it at
once with the embryonic body to build it up to the
perfection of manhood, and at the same moment God
the Son assumed this humanity into substantial union
with His Divine Person.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is the second step in the career of our King,
again a species of self-annihilation: <span lang="la"><i>Exinanivit semetipsum</i></span>.
It is also an example of His love for men, of
His boundless zeal for their salvation and glorification.
He stooped down to earth in order to raise man to
Heaven.</p>

<h3 id='day4-c' class='c011'>CONSIDERATION <br> On the Imitation of Christ</h3>
<p class='c006'>The main truth that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius inculcates, both in
the meditation on the Kingdom of Christ and in all the
subsequent portions of his Exercises, is that man must
be perfected by imitating Christ, by making himself
like to the Son of God made man, according to the
words of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul: “Whom God foreknew he also
predestinated to be made conformable to the image of
his Son, that he might be the first-born among many
brethren” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii</abbr>, 29).</p>

<p class='c007'>The intense love of God, which the Saint conceived
during his retreat at Manresa, prompted him to make
himself as like to Christ as, with God’s grace, was possible;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>and the zeal for the salvation of souls, which he
learned from the example of Christ, urged him to
form a band of men like to himself, or rather like to
the God-man, a select band to be, as it were, a bodyguard
of the Divine King in the holy warfare, undertaken
to establish the Kingdom of God. This is the
spirit of the Society of Jesus, and of all religious
Orders, and to some extent of all who wish to attain
perfection. For this purpose the principal means to
be used is the study of the life of Christ, which is to
be the chief occupation of the exercitant during this
and the following days. It is not a work of human
skill, but one of the direct influence of the Holy Spirit;
He alone can produce in the heart of man the supernatural
likeness to the Son of God. As He sanctified
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, so He sanctifies all those who faithfully
and generously perform these exercises.</p>

<p class='c007'>We may, in some respects, compare the process of
sanctification to the work of a painter who produces
an exquisite likeness of a distinguished personage on
his canvas. The first outlines of the supernatural
likeness of a child of men to the Son of God are traced
by the Divine Artist in the Sacrament of Baptism.
The infant’s soul receives the precious impress as the
unconscious canvas receives the colors, without its
own co-operation. Yet already then the difference is
immense between a mere child of earth and an adopted
child of God. But very much remains to be accomplished
by the Holy Ghost before the likeness is perfected.
And this increase of sanctification is the most
important work that is being done on earth from generation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>to generation: “For the perfecting of the
Saints—for the edifying of the body of Christ” (<abbr title='Ephesians'>Eph.</abbr>
<abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 12).</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of this further sanctification is to be produced
by the Holy Ghost in our hearts with our co-operation:
He teaches us how to <i>make ourselves</i> like to Christ,
while He aids us to do it. For His teaching does not
consist in simply suggesting to us what we must do, as
we teach a child its Catechism; but He acts as does a
music teacher with his pupils, who makes them constantly
practise what they are learning. It is by their
own efforts that they are to acquire the art. So the
Spirit of God makes us like unto Christ by helping us to
act as Christ did, to practise the virtues of which He
has given us the example. In this consists the sanctification
of the soul, in the imitation of Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'>How Christ acted during His whole career, from
His incarnation to His ascension, this is the study of
the second, third and fourth weeks of the Exercises.
We will here call attention to some of the characteristic
traits of His life on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. His conduct was diametrically opposed to that
by which Adam and Eve had forfeited their original
happiness. They had aspired to rise above their own
condition and become like unto God. For the Devil
had said: “God doth know that in what day soever
you shall eat thereof, your eyes shall be opened, and
you shall be as gods, knowing good and evil” (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr>
<abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 5). Christ, on the contrary, while being God,
stooped down and made Himself man; and He continued
lowering Himself more and more, becoming the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>poorest child on earth, born in a stable, laid upon straw,
“a worm and no man, the reproach of men and the
outcast of the people” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 21), condemned to a
shameful death, and, as a criminal, crucified with
thieves. If then we wish to be like Christ, we must
practise humility.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Another characteristic trait of Christ’s conduct
is seen in the means He used to establish the Kingdom
of His Father. He could have made the colossal
power of Rome His tool to effect that purpose, or have
employed the wisdom of the philosophers or the elegance
of the writers of that classic age. But instead
He used ignorant and timid men, and first gathered
into His fold the poor and despised of the earth, as
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul expressed it: “For see your vocation,
brethren, that there are not many wise according to
the flesh, not many mighty, not many noble; but the
foolish things of the world hath God chosen that he
may confound the wise, and the weak things of the
world hath God chosen that he may confound the
strong, and the base things of the world, and the
things that are contemptible hath God chosen, and
things that are not, that He might bring to naught
things that are, that no flesh should glory in His sight”
(<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 26-29).</p>

<p class='c007'>Must we then, to imitate Christ, cast all human
learning to the winds? By no means; but we must understand
that merely natural means cannot produce
supernatural effects, that all the learning and all the
power of the world cannot save or sanctify a soul.
And therefore we must trust in supernatural means.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>As to the natural means, Christ did not need them to
accomplish His purpose; but we must use all the means,
natural and supernatural, that God puts at our disposal;
yet remembering all along that we must put our
main confidence in the supernatural, in the help of
grace, which is secured by the imitation of our King.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must then ever keep our eyes upon Him, study
His example, and reproduce His virtues in ourselves.
It will often happen that to act thus we must do things
which seem foolish in the eyes of a worldly wisdom, as
when <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis Borgia resigned his office of viceroy,
in which he was doing so much good, to hide himself
in the religious state; or when the Seven Holy Founders
of the Servites of Mary gave up all their riches to
become poor like Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'>A beautiful illustration of the way in which we are
to imitate the Saviour is given us in the Book of
Judges, where Gedeon and his three hundred followers
rescued their people from oppression by means apparently
most unwise, yet fully successful because they
obeyed God with heroic fidelity. Gedeon was designed
by Divine Providence to be a type of Christ. Jesus
is our Gedeon, and we can learn how we must follow
Him by studying the story of Gedeon in Holy Writ.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Israelites in his day had been conquered by the
Madianites and Amalekites, who were overrunning
their land with a countless army, and destroying all
they could not carry off. The Chosen People were reduced
to a state of slavery and starvation. So they
repented of their idolatry, and called upon the Lord for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>pardon and mercy. God sent them a savior in the person
of the faithful Gedeon. This hero, encouraged
by miracles, which he had seen, destroyed the altar
and the grove of Baal, and then gathered together
32,000 men, trusting in God that with this small force
he could defeat the vast number of the foes. But
God told him his followers were too many; if they conquered,
they would attribute the victory to their own
prowess. He bade him choose only 300 of them, and
promised Gedeon that with these alone he would gain a
complete victory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now notice how this was accomplished; it was by
means apparently most rash and foolish. The Scripture
narrates it thus: “Gedeon divided the 300 men
into three parts, and gave them trumpets in their hands,
and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.
And he said to them: I will go into one part of the
camp, and <i>do you as I shall do</i>. When the trumpet
shall sound, in my hand, blow you also the trumpets
on every side of the camp.—They began to sound their
trumpets, and clap the pitchers one against another—And
they cried out, The sword of the Lord and of
Gedeon—And the Lord sent the sword into all the
camp and they killed one another” (Judges <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 16-22).</p>

<p class='c007'>The immense army of the foe was destroyed, and
the country delivered by the 300 unarmed men. These
had simply done what they saw their leader do, and
God had done the rest. Christ is our Gedeon; we
must simply do what He did, and God will do the rest:
He will establish His Kingdom in our hearts, and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>us, no matter how weak the instruments, effect the salvation
of souls.</p>
<h3 id='day4-m3' class='c011'>THIRD MEDITATION <br> On the Birth of Christ</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Recall the facts to mind, by reading
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 1-20.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> See the stable, with the Divine Infant
lying on the straw in the manger, with Mary and
Joseph kneeling in adoration.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask to understand how Christ has
loved you, that you may love Him ardently and follow
Him faithfully.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider how Mary and Joseph received
the order to go from Nazareth to Bethlehem to
be enrolled there. Notice the persons, their words
and their actions.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>The pagan emperor</i> who ordered the census, no
matter what was his motive, was an agent of Divine
Providence to bring the Holy Family to Bethlehem.
His order had been issued three years before; it arrived
at Nazareth just at the right time for God’s purposes.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i><abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joseph</i> brings it home, knowing what inconvenience
it would cause, but resigned to God’s will.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>Mary</i>, though she sees it comes at a most inopportune
time, as far as man can judge, has only
words and thoughts of cheerful submission to the
voice of authority. Both prepare at once for the
journey, and start as soon as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>See the Holy Family arriving in Bethlehem.</i>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>They have traveled five days, over 110 miles,
Mary perhaps riding on an ass or in a rude cart, and
Joseph leading the animal. Both now are dust begrimed
and tired out, glad to get at last to the one inn
of the town; but they are disappointed and find no
room there to receive them. Follow them in imagination
as they wander through the poorer streets, asking
here and there for a night’s lodging, but refused at
every door. Here now are the holiest persons that ever
trod the earth, and see how the Lord allows them to
suffer for our example of patience. And the Divine
Child, how helpless: “He came unto his own, and his
own received him not” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 11). Happy they,
if any such there were, who spoke a kind word to them,
even a word of excuse for a refusal; it must have
brought a blessing. Do I always speak kindly to the
poor? Do I render every service I can? God willed
it all, that Jesus might be born in a stable, rather than
in a comfortable cottage; laid on straw, rather than on
a cushion. Our edification is all the greater on Christmas
day. But their lot was hard. So too our sufferings
shall be turned into joy.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>Behold the stable</i>, in which they have
found a refuge. Cattle were there before them, and
the floor is littered with their leavings. Mary and
Joseph patiently tidy up a spot where they may rest,
and collect the cleanest blades of straw to lay them in
the manger, provident for the expected birth of the
Divine Child.</p>

<p class='c007'>There, during the night, Mary is miraculously delivered,
and in an ecstasy of love and joy, presses the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Son of God to her maternal breast. She tenderly
wraps Him in the swaddling clothes she has brought
along for the purpose, and reposes Him upon the straw
of the manger, that she and Joseph may kneel before
Him in humble adoration. Angels are there of course
to honor the King of glory; but they appear not to the
sight nor charm the ear with their Heavenly song, that
all may be as desolate as possible. He came to share
our poverty and our loneliness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile His glory is beginning to be manifested
elsewhere. For a bright angel announces to the
shepherds the birth of a “Saviour, who is Christ the
Lord in the city of David,” and he adds: “This shall
be a sign unto you; you shall find the infant wrapped
in swaddling clothes, and laid in a manger. And suddenly
there was with the angel a multitude of the
heavenly army, praising God and saying: Glory to
God in the highest, and on earth peace to men of good
will” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 11-14).</p>

<p class='c007'>He who came to assume our poverty made the poor
His favorites; to them He was first revealed. If we
wish to enjoy His favors, let us be satisfied with little,
study rather with how little we can get along than how
much we can acquire. “Blessed are the poor in spirit,
for theirs is the kingdom of heaven” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>,
3).</p>

<p class='c007'>The closest followers of Christ are known by their
resemblance to Him. And how is He known? The
Angel has proclaimed it: by His poverty: “And this
shall be a sign unto you; you shall find the infant
wrapped in swaddling clothes, and laid in a manger.”</p>

</div>
<h3 id='day5-m1' class='c011'>THE FIRST MEDITATION <br> On the Flight into Egypt</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Recall the facts, as narrated by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Matthew <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 13-19.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> See <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joseph quietly asleep in the
night, and the Angel standing before him to deliver his
message.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask the grace to understand the lessons
taught in this mystery by Jesus, Mary and Joseph,
so as to know your King more intimately, love Him
more ardently and follow Him more faithfully.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Point <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>Consider the message of the Angel</i>,
noticing particularly the persons, their words and their
actions.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>The persons.</i> The Angel is a faithful messenger,
a model of exactitude when a task is entrusted to
us. He addresses Joseph because he is the head of the
family. So God usually directs us through our superiors,
even if these should be less able, even as Joseph
was less gifted than the others. Jesus and Mary are
not visited: “Take the child and his mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Consider the <i>words</i> spoken: “Arise and take
the child and his mother, and fly into Egypt, and be
there until I shall tell thee; for it will come to pass that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Herod will seek the child to destroy him.” The action
required implies many great difficulties; first a very
long journey of hundreds of miles, and that through a
wild country, where savage animals and robbers
roamed. The parable of the Good Samaritan shows
that robbers infested those regions, and the watch kept
by the shepherds points to the presence of wolves, bears,
etc. Then they are to leave at once, with no provisions
for so long a journey: “Arise, and take, etc.” They
are not even to say a kind farewell to the neighbors who
had befriended them, but must leave in secret like
criminals. And the motive assigned by the Angel is
unsatisfactory to human reason: “Herod will seek
the child to destroy him.” Were there not a thousand
easier ways to prevent this? Was not God wise and
powerful enough to save His Divine Son in Bethlehem?
Or could they not have gone to Mary’s cousin
Elizabeth, where young John the Baptist was living in
security? Perhaps we might have been self-opiniated
enough to find such objections; but Jesus, Mary and
Joseph did not criticize.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>The Actions</i> of these exhibit a prompt, cheerful
and perfect obedience. These are our models. Have
we always acted thus? Is it our habit now to do so?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>Consider the exile itself.</i> How the
Holy Family was supported during the many weeks
their travel must have lasted, we cannot imagine.
They may have suffered many severe hardships; most
probably they did, since Christ had come to give the
example of patience under sufferings. But God’s
Providence watched over every step of theirs, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>supplied all their wants as far as was conformable to
His designs.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did not do so only on account of their privileged
personalities, but He ever does the same for all who
trust in Him. “I say to you, be not solicitous for your
life, what you shall eat, nor for your body, what you
shall put on—for after all these things do the heathens
seek. For your Father knoweth that you have need
of all these things. Seek you therefore first the Kingdom
of God and His justice, and all these things shall
be added unto you” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 25-33).</p>

<p class='c007'>We can especially trust in God’s assistance when we
are obeying His commands, as was the Holy Family at
that time. Therefore we should love to be directed by
our superiors, who make known God’s will to us. And
again, works done under obedience with a willing mind
have a special blessing on them. “An obedient man
shall speak of victory” (<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-one'>xxi</abbr>, 28). The heroic
virtues practised in later ages by the solitaries in those
deserts may well have been the fruit of the obedience
then practised by the Holy Family.</p>

<p class='c007'>Their stay in Egypt for several years among strangers
is best appreciated by those persons who have themselves
experienced the bitterness of exile. Christ knew
that many of His followers would endure those ills,
and He wished to leave them a most consoling example.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Consider the massacre of the Innocents.</i>
All its cruelty was meant for Christ, and cruel
persecution has been continued against His followers
throughout the ages, and is so to the present day. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>had foretold it: “The disciple is not above the master,
nor the servant above his lord. If they have called
the good-man of the house Beelzebub, how much more
them of his household” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 24-25). We
must then be patient under any kind of molestation,
though of course we may use all honest means to prevent
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The persecution works the good of them who properly
endure it. See this exemplified in the massacre of
the innocents. It was very wickedly done, a cruel injustice
and bitter suffering to the little ones, and a still
more dreadful affliction to their mothers; but it resulted
in eternal glory for the children. When a priest blesses
an article of devotion, he makes a cross over it; so the
Lord bestows His blessings with a cross. Every sorrow
comes from the hand of our loving Lord, and is
meant for the good of those who love Him: “To them
that love God all things work together unto good”
(<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii,</abbr> 28).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> With Jesus and Mary, begging for constant
fidelity in the imitation of my Divine Model amid
all trials, with a firm confidence in His loving providence:
“Know ye that no one hath hoped in the Lord
and hath been confounded” (<abbr title='Ecclesiasticus'>Ecclus.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 11).</p>
<h3 id='day5-m2' class='c011'>THE SECOND MEDITATION <br> On the Private Life of Christ</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Recall the few verses in which Holy
Writ records the history of the eighteen years of
Christ’s private life, from His loss in the temple to His
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>entrance on His public life: “And he went down
with them, and came to Nazareth; and was subject to
them. And his mother kept all these words in her
heart. And Jesus advanced in wisdom and age, and
grace with God and men” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 51-52), “Is not
this the carpenter’s son?” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>, 55).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you see the modest cottage
of the Holy Family at Nazareth, where Mary is preparing
a meal, while Joseph and the youthful Saviour
are working in the adjacent carpenter shop.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask grace to understand the wonderful
lessons of sanctity here taught, and to grow in the
love and imitation of your Redeemer.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider the words: “<i>He went down
with them and came to Nazareth.</i>” He might have
moved in the midst of the world, as He had done for
three days when lost in Jerusalem, but He wished to
give an example which people generally could imitate.
Nearly all persons must lead a private life during the
greater portion, if not the whole of their career. Restlessness
to be abroad is very injurious to virtue. But
the inner life, needed to attain perfection, is favored by
retirement from the world. Hence all founders of religious
orders require a retired novitiate, and the
Church strictly prescribes enclosure, which law has not
been relaxed except where charity to the neighbor demands
it. It is not the spirit of God that makes some
priests aspire to conspicuous offices and functions.
Nazareth was good enough for Christ, though it was so
obscure a town that Nathanael asked, “Can anything
good come from Nazareth?” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 46). It is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>bad sign when a religious is displeased because applied
to obscure duties.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Consider the words, “<i>And He was subject
to them</i>”; that is, Jesus was subject to Mary and
Joseph. This is the chief lesson Christ chose to teach
the world during the first thirty years of His life. It
must then be of the utmost importance. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Gregory
says of it: “Obedience is a virtue which, by itself
alone, plants all other virtues in the mind and preserves
them after they are once planted” (<abbr class='spell'>L.</abbr> 35 Mor. <abbr class='spell'>c.</abbr> 10).
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, in his “Epistle on Obedience,” quoted
these words with emphatic approbation; and he has
made this the characteristic virtue of his Society. In
fact the vow of obedience belongs to the essence of the
religious life, and some orders comprise all the obligation
of their members under the one vow of “obedience
according to their rule.” My perfection as a religious
depends chiefly on the perfection of my obedience.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consider besides, in meditating on Christ’s private
life, who was the Person that obeyed; namely God
Himself in His human nature. Whom did He obey?
His own creatures infinitely beneath Him in every respect.
In what did He obey?</p>

<p class='c007'>In all the details of His life; in working for instance,
under the direction of Joseph, after the unskilful manner
of that time. How perfectly do I obey my superiors?
I must make myself like unto Christ, not in
working miracles, but in submitting to my superiors.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Christ spent His private life in humble
labor.</i> Such a career is intended by the Lord for the
vast majority of mankind. It is the sentence pronounced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>upon our race: “In the sweat of thy face
thou shalt eat bread till thou return to the earth out of
which thou wast taken” (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 19). Such labor
fosters devotion. It has always been fondly cherished
in learned religious bodies. During his voyage to India
which lasted thirteen months, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis Xavier
used to wash his soiled linen in the sight of his fellow-passengers,
while bearing the dignity of Apostolic Nuncio,
and he would never consent to be waited on by
others (Life, Bartholi and Maffei, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 74).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>.</i> “<i>And Jesus advanced in wisdom and
age, and grace with God and men.</i>” It is by the faithful
and steady exercise of the virtues taught by our
Divine model that Christians ever grow in sanctity; for
sanctity consists in this. And thus there are thousands
to-day, as in every period of the Church, of whom it
can be said with truth, as is here said of the Blessed
Saviour, that they are growing in wisdom as they are
advancing in age; and as a consequence they grow in
grace with God; and meanwhile they also become daily
more perfect subjects of edification to their fellow-men.</p>

<p class='c007'>That young religious are expected to resemble Christ
in steady progress in virtue is of course understood by
all. But this should not be confined to young religious.
Older religious must persevere in this imitation of
Christ; their own welfare requires it, and the welfare
of the younger generation, who are naturally much
influenced by the example of their elders. All who
profess to follow Christ should therefore grow constantly
in wisdom and obedience, in humility and generosity,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>in charity and devotion, and in all the virtues,
of which He has given such bright examples.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with our Divine Lord, asking earnestly
that we may know Him more intimately, love Him
more ardently and follow Him more faithfully; and
that we may correct the faults we have discovered in us
during this meditation.</p>
<h3 id='day5-c' class='c011'>CONSIDERATION <br> On the Imitation of Christ’s Private Life</h3>
<p class='c006'>Since most of our progress in virtue is to be effected
by our imitation of Christ’s private life, it is worth
while adding to the meditation we have made on that
subject some further appropriate considerations. Let
us examine in what exactly lay the excellence of that
great model.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='one'>I</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'>It did not consist in the use of extraordinary
austerities, such as were practised by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John the Baptist,
whose holiness was so highly extolled by the
Saviour Himself. That would not have been a suitable
model of imitation for mankind generally.
Christ’s sanctity was of course infinitely superior; and
it is the pattern on which our virtue must be modeled.</p>

<p class='c007'>In fact Christ’s private life was not distinguished
from the common lives of men by unusual bodily hardships.
Millions of men and women in our day, and in
civilized lands, toil harder and enjoy fewer material
comforts than did the Holy Family. See how hard is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>the lot of vast numbers of our laboring classes. See
them going to their work at early morning, carrying
their cold lunches in their baskets, their only support
for the toils of the day. Their labor is fatiguing and
protracted, often quite exhausting, as is manifested by
the bent forms and wasted frames of so many of them.
All day they hear rebukes, harsh and gross language;
and with their best efforts very many can scarcely earn
enough to keep up their strength. And when they return
at night, exhausted and begrimed with dirt, they
have no comfortable cottage to rest their wearied
limbs; only some room in a tenement house, or in a
garret or cellar, crowded together with their wives and
children, amidst a rude and often vicious crowd of
associates. Compared to their life that of the Holy
Family was one of decent comfort.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='two'>II</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'><i>What then made the life of Christ so very holy and
so very meritorious? Especially two qualities.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. Of course His Divine Person gave infinite merit
to every act performed by Him in His human nature.
Now it is a great consolation for us to remember that,
by the gracious dispensation of the Lord, we too are
children of God, adopted brothers of Christ, as long
as we live in the state of grace; and, by the aid of the
Holy spirit, who is diffused in our hearts, we can make
our acts worthy of supernatural reward. And all this
merit keeps on accumulating throughout our conscious
life, unless it be lost by mortal sin. Our principal fear
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>ought ever to be lest we thus foolishly lose it, and our
bitterest regret if we have done so.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The second source of holiness in Christ was <i>the
perfection of his intention</i>, ever aiming purely at the
glory of His Heavenly Father. This also we can and
we ought to imitate, with the help of grace offered us
for this purpose. Here lies in fact the principal means
of improving our resemblance to Christ. And we can
do so constantly, even in our commonest actions, as the
Apostle teaches us saying: “Whether you eat or drink
or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God” (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr>
<abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 31).</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a very appropriate occupation for the time of
the yearly retreat to examine carefully to what extent
we act habitually for a supernatural intention, one resting
on the faith, and not merely directed to some
natural advantage. It is the intention that determines
the true value of every human act. Whatever is done
for some temporal good alone can only claim a temporal
reward. What am I habitually working for?
Is it only for some material or intellectual success?
Or am I actuated to a great extent by a merely natural
impulse? Even though such impulse be not sinful, not
opposed to reason, still it is so much time and energy
wasted on the things of earth, and cannot add to my
eternal happiness. To act thus, as far as supernatural
reward is concerned, is without result, as one would
waste his time and labor who would spend hours in
sewing without thread, or writing without ink in his
pen.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>People do not act so foolishly in the affairs of this
life; but very many do so in the things of eternity. Is
not a great portion of my own life thus habitually
wasted by the want of a supernatural intention?
What improvement can I make in this matter?</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='three'>III</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'>We are explicitly warned by our Blessed Saviour
against <i>two copious sources of waste of time and labor</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The first regards actions which appear to be very
reasonable and virtuous; for instance the exercises of
kindness to our friends and relatives, or the practice of
any other natural virtues in human intercourse. Of
all these Christ said: “If you love them that love you,
what reward shall you have? Do not even the publicans
this? And if you salute your brethren only, what
do you do more? Do not also the heathens this?”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 46-47). We ought to love our friends
for God’s sake.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The second source of waste is a very copious one
among men, even among religious; namely doing what
is quite proper, but only to gain the esteem of others.</p>

<p class='c007'>This regard for the good opinion of our fellow-men
is not sinful in itself, as is erroneously supposed by
some pious writers, who would have penitents accuse
themselves in Confession of vanity when they have
said or done anything to attract favorable attention or
gain praise. Every sin is essentially a violation of a
law of God. But there is no law of God forbidding us
to seek the approbation of sensible persons. Does a
boy sin by trying to please his parents? Does a student
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>sin by trying to gain a prize? Jansenists would think
so, but such is not Catholic doctrine.</p>

<p class='c007'>The desire of praise is a constant encouragement to
the practice of the natural virtues. Sin enters when
praise is sought for doing what is unreasonable, or
when we take all the credit of good conduct to ourselves,
forgetting that our very goodness is a gift of
God. For this is blamed by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul: “What hast
thou that thou hast not received? and if thou hast received,
why dost thou glory as if thou hadst not received?”
(<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 7). There is unfortunately plenty
of sin in the world; but we must avoid increasing it by
forming false consciences.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yet, even when reasonable praise is sought, and no
sin committed, there may be great evil in the loss of
merit for Heaven; and the imitation of Christ will
teach us to avoid that evil. He acted in all things for
the glory of His Heavenly Father. “I seek not my
own glory,” He said to the Jews; and again: “He that
sends me is with me,—for I do always the things that
please him” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='eight'>viii,</abbr> 50, 29). By imitating the
Saviour in this, we become more and more like unto
Him, and we lay up abundant treasures for Heaven.</p>

<p class='c007'>But He earnestly warns us not to lose such precious
merit, saying: “Take heed that you do not your justice
before men, to be seen by them; otherwise you shall
not have reward of your Father, who is in Heaven”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 1). And speaking, in the next verse of
the hypocrites who gave alms that they might be seen
by men, the Saviour adds: “They have received their
reward.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>But the loss of supernatural reward is not the only
evil resulting from the seeking of human praise; for,
though, as we have seen, seeking such honor is not in
itself a sin, still it is very often the cause of sin, even of
mortal sin. For praise is very apt to affect the mind
somewhat as intoxicants affect the body; it arouses an
inordinate greed of more and more of the stimulant.
The more we get of it, the more are various passions
aroused within us, and we are likely to become ambitious
of honor and of superiority over others, conceited
and contemptuous of others, becoming infatuated with
our supposed good qualities; in a word we gradually
become proud, and a proud man is an abomination to
the Lord, or, as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke expresses it: “That which is
high to men is an abomination before God” (<abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 15).</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='four'>IV</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'>A third cause that made the life of Christ so holy
was that <i>He did everything perfectly well</i>: “He hath
done all things well” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 37). Our goodness
does not consist so much in what we do as in the
manner in which we do it. In fact, during the thirty
years of His private life, which we are now studying,
Christ did no great things whatever. His occupations
were of the humblest kind; millions of men are doing
the same day after day; but His actions derived their
excellence from the perfection wherewith He did them,
and our goodness consists in imitating His perfect manner
of acting.</p>

<p class='c007'>The excellence of a masterpiece in painting and
sculpture results from the excellent delicacy and appropriateness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>of every, even the smallest, detail; the beauty
of a specimen of good penmanship does not result from
bold dashes, but from the perfection of every single
letter; and so the excellence of the life of Christ, and
the lives of those who wish to become like unto Him,
lies not in doing great things, but in doing everything
excellently well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Few of us, if any, have occasion of doing many great
things in the course of our life; but we can all, with
God’s grace, do a multitude of little things well, and
thus resemble our Divine model. Our crown in
Heaven will not consist of some one or two magnificent
jewels, as does the crown of many glorious Martyrs,
but of countless little gems, each shining with its own
peculiar lustre. These are the lessons we should learn
from the private life of the God incarnate.</p>
<h3 id='day5-m3' class='c011'>THE THIRD MEDITATION <br> On the Public Life of Christ</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Recall the facts: Christ began His
public labors for the salvation of souls by leaving His
Blessed Mother, by being baptized among sinners, then
fasting forty days. Next He travelled on foot from
town to town during three years, in great poverty,
through Galilee and Judea; selected ignorant men as
His Apostles, instructed them most patiently, and predicted
His sacred passion.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold Christ, attended by His Apostles,
while He addresses a miscellaneous multitude.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask earnestly that you may learn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>from Him an intense zeal for souls and generosity in
following His example.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider the grandeur of the work of
saving souls. It is the noblest occupation possible, as is
expressed in the maxim attributed to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Dionysius the
Areopagite: “The most Divine of all Divine works is
the salvation of souls.” In fact the saving of one soul
is a higher achievement than the creation of the material
universe; for the value of an action is properly
measured by the result achieved, and a glorified soul is
as far above all bodily substances as the knowledge, love
and fruition of God is above mere matter. We admire
the poet who composes a grand epic, the painter or
sculptor who produces a masterpiece of his noble art,
the architect who erects an imposing structure, etc.;
but what is all this compared to the salvation of a soul,
that will be for eternity an ornament of Heaven. To
Christ belongs the glory of all salvation of souls, but
He deigns to share this glory with His followers, to
whom He says: “I have chosen you and have appointed
you that you should go and bring forth fruit
and that your fruit should remain” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 16).</p>

<p class='c007'>What a noble object to work for! And while a soul
is so precious, its salvation is to be effected in a short
time. We may at times achieve this wonderful success
in a single hour.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Consider the example set us by the Son
of God to accomplish this purpose: 1. He left His
Blessed Mother, and we do not read that He ever returned
to her home. This ought to encourage us to
make similar sacrifices. 2. He so humbled Himself as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>to be baptized among sinners; and, to call down the
blessings of Heaven upon His sacred ministry, He
spent forty days in fasting and prayer. By all this He
taught us that the supernatural work of saving souls
is to be accomplished by the supernatural means of humiliations
and penance and prayer; mere eloquence and
logic are not sufficient. 3. He endured many privations.
For during those three years He and His Apostles
had not the comforts of a home: “The foxes have
holes, and the birds of the air nests, but the son of
man hath not where to lay his head” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii</abbr>,
20). They often spent the night in the open air, for
instance in the Garden of Olives. They had no regular
supply of food, and must often have endured bitter
hunger. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Matthew narrates an instance: “At that
time Jesus went through the corn on the Sabbath; and
His disciples being hungry began to pluck the ears and
to eat them” (<abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>, 1). He travelled and taught the
people all day and received visitors during the night,
like Nicodemus and Joseph of Arithmathea, who were
His disciples secretly for fear of the Jews.</p>

<p class='c007'>The history of the Saints is full of similar hardships;
for they had learned to follow His example. Am I a
worthy follower of my King? Do I make generous
sacrifices in His service? Frequently the salvation or
the loss of a soul depends on the zeal of a priest or
religious. Neglect in this matter is often irreparable.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> During His public life Jesus also gave
us the example of earnest prayer, in which He would at
times spend the entire night. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke writes: “He
(Jesus) went out into a mountain to pray, and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>passed the whole night in the prayer of God” (<abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 12).
He did not need to pray for His own sake, but He
wished to show us by His example the necessity of
fervent prayer for those employed in the active duty of
saving souls. They need it for themselves and for the
good of others. For themselves, because the sacred
ministry is full of dangers; it is like striving to save
drowning men, in which task those who lend assistance
often perish themselves. Sad experience teaches that
many priests, employed in constant labors, neglect their
own souls, and come to a miserable fall. And as far as
the neighbor is concerned, it is the man of prayer, the
man of God, that does the work of God, and not the
priest of a worldly mind who neglects his prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'>With what devotion do I offer the holy sacrifice of
the Mass? receive Holy Communion? make my meditation?
recite the Divine Office? The annual retreat
is the time to consider all these things and to provide
for improvements.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with our Dear Lord, praying for an increase
of fervor in prayer, of zeal for souls, of generosity
in the labors of the ministry.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>
  <h2 id='day6' class='c005'>THE SIXTH DAY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>After we have meditated on the Kingdom of Christ,
His self-annihilation, His private life and His zealous
labors, we must now consider the plots and efforts of
the archenemy Satan, who opposes Him at every point.
For life is a continuous warfare: “The life of man
upon earth is a warfare,” says Job; and in every war
there are of course two opposing forces. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine
in his celebrated work on “The City of God,” compared
together the working of those conflicting powers,
the impersonations of virtue and vice, of humility and
pride. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius here proposes a similar parable,
for the purpose of discovering the plots and snares of
Satan to ruin souls, contrasting them with Christ’s
plans and labors to procure their eternal happiness.</p>
<h3 id='day6-m1' class='c011'>THE FIRST MEDITATION <br> On the Two Standards</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> The figure under which the two opposing
forces are presented by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius is that of two
armies encamped, the one near Babylon, the city of
confusion, as the name signifies; the other near Jerusalem,
that sacred city of peace. In the former camp
Satan is seen elevated on a throne of fire and smoke,
his countenance horrible to behold. He is surrounded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>by countless demons, whom he is instructing how to
compass the ruin of souls. In the other camp the
Blessed Saviour stands humbly in the midst of His
followers, Angels and men, His countenance beaming
with kindness, while teaching them how to gain all
hearts for virtue and happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you behold these two camps
with their respective leaders.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for light to understand the
treacherous schemes of Satan, that you may oppose
them in yourself and in others, and may lead all to obey
Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Study the special features of Satan’s
camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. It is near Babylon, where the tower of Babel
once stood, to signify the pride and the confusion
which Satan ever labors to stir up in the hearts of men.
He is elevated on a throne, to denote the ambition he
arouses in all to rise above their fellows. The throne
consists of flames, ever restless, and smoke, darkening
the mind of his miserable dupes. His monstrous features
reflect the ugly vices of his heart.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Listen to his address: “Go into every country,
every province, every city, town and hamlet, enter into
every house, and tempt every man, woman and child to
grasp for the good things of this world. Most of
them are easily enticed to the greed of money and
riches, the accumulation of which seems to them reasonable
and proper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When they become rich, tempt them to the ambition
of honor, by which they are puffed up with self-esteem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>and the spirit of independence of God.” This spirit is
the very essence of pride, and the subversion of the
moral order. The world is full of minds independent
of God; they are the conquests of Satan. Beginning
with what appears proper enough, they are gradually
led to the abyss of sin.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The demon understands full well that the temptation
is to be adapted to each one’s character. With
many there is from the beginning an inordinate love of
honor and distinction; these may at once be assailed
on their weak point and more rapidly led into pride.
Others are more readily allured by the bait of pleasure;
they may first be tempted by innocent amusements, then
by more inordinate enjoyment, till they cast off all restraint,
loving self to the contempt of the Creator,
which is but another form of pride.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Now consider the opposing camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. There behold the gentle Saviour, not enthroned,
but humbly standing in the midst of His followers, as
it were an equal to the least. His serene countenance
is lit by a genial smile, inspiring all with love and confidence;</p>

<p class='c007'>“Beautiful above the sons of men, grace is poured
abroad in thy lips—Thou hast loved justice and hated
iniquity; therefore God, thy God, hath annointed thee
with the oil of gladness above thy fellows” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 44).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Listen to the instructions He gives to His Angels
and the human ministers of His mercy. He says:
“Go ye into the whole world, to every country, every
province, every city, town and hamlet, enter every
house, and induce every man, woman, and child to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>labor for their eternal happiness, by the practice of self-restraint
and moderation in all their desires; let all be
satisfied with a decent competency of wealth, detaching
their hearts from earthly possessions, so as to acquire
poverty of spirit, and to be ready to embrace even
actual poverty, if the spirit of God should be pleased
to lead them to that perfection. Induce them next to
willingness to be slighted, even despised, so as to resemble
Me more closely. The result will be true humility,
which is the root of all the virtues.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i>, first with your Mother Mary, asking her to
obtain from her Divine Son, true poverty of spirit, and
willingness to become actually poor, if God should wish
it. Then ask the Saviour through His love for Mary,
as man, to obtain these graces for you from His Heavenly
Father. Lastly ask the Father to grant you the
same through His love for His Divine Son. This
triple colloquy is a powerful prayer.</p>
<h3 id='day6-m2' class='c011'>THE SECOND MEDITATION <br> On the Three Degrees of Humility</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you behold Christ, who says
to you: “My son, I will now show you the highest
point of perfection to which I desire you to aspire for
the present.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Speak, O Lord, Thy servant heareth.
Give me the grace of generously complying with Thy
invitation.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>The first degree</i> of virtue, also called the
first degree of humility, consists in such a disposition of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>heart, such firm attachment to our good Lord, that
nothing in the world, not even the danger of death, can
make us even deliberate about committing a mortal sin.
This degree is necessary for all men, it is the habitual
state of all good Christians. Weakness or passion
may sometimes cause them to fall; but they soon rise
again, and return to this state of mind. It is in fact
simply the application of the words of Christ: “If
thy right hand scandalize thee, cut it off: it is better for
thee to enter into life maimed, than having two hands
to go into hell, into unquenchable fire” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark <abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>,
42). Let us thank God that we have attained this
degree at least; but let us also consider whether any
passion is so unrestrained within us as to expose us to a
serious fall. No man is safe as long as he lives; some
make a sad failure in the end. They fare like the vessel
that came from the New World with loads of gold
and silver on board, and was wrecked in sight of the
Golden Gate, the harbor of San Francisco, while its
sailors were answering the hurrahs of welcome rising
from the crowd of spectators on the shore.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>The second degree</i> consists in such an
habitual state of mind that we would rather do or suffer
anything, even rather die, than enter into deliberation
about committing even a wilful venial sin. This degree
supposes considerable indifference to the good
things or the evils of this world. It is the habitual
state of fervent religious; they may be surprised into
venial sins, but they rarely commit them with full deliberation.
Let us try to establish ourselves firmly in this
degree; and if we find difficulty in this, let us pray
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>most earnestly for help, and do ourselves violence.
“The Kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the
violent bear it away” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 12). We should
not rest satisfied till, by prayer and efforts, we have
confirmed ourselves in this degree.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>The third degree</i> consists in such devoted
attachment to our Blessed Saviour that we wish
to be like Him, to be in suffering and forgotten, or even
despised by men, as He was; so that, where duty does
not require the contrary, we wish, even without a view
to any reward, to share His afflictions, for no other
reason than because Christ, our dearest friend and Sovereign
Lord endured the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus when a member of a decent family is in a dying
condition, all the other members abstain from feasting
or attending pleasure parties; so too, because our Lord
led a poor and humble life, enduring intense hardships
and sufferings, we wish to bear a share in His afflictions.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an accomplished artist takes great delight in practising
his art, in which a beginner finds only labor and
difficulties, so those derive most happiness from the
practice of virtue who have attained in it uncommon
proficiency. The sentiments of this third degree are
beautifully expressed in the Prayer of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Xavier, <span lang="la">“O
Deus: ego amo te,”</span> etc. (page 132).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The colloquy</i> is three-fold: 1. Begging the Blessed
Virgin to obtain for us from her Divine Son the grace
of frequently eliciting acts of this third degree. 2.
Begging our Divine Lord to ask this grace for us from
His Heavenly Father. 3. Begging our Heavenly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Father to grant us the same, through the love He has
for His Divine Son.</p>
<h3 id='day6-c' class='c011'>CONSIDERATION <br> On Temptations</h3>
<p class='c006'>In the meditation on the Two Standards we studied
the manner in which the evil spirit tempts the souls of
men, leading them from apparently innocent beginnings
to total independence of their Creator. We must now
consider the subject of temptations in further detail.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='one'>I</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'><i>Why does the Devil hate men?</i> Because he hates
God, and as he cannot injure God, he wreaks his
vengeance on God’s images and children. Now man is
created in the image of God, and all men are, or at
least are destined to be, elevated to the dignity of children
of God. Besides, they are intended to occupy in
Heaven the thrones which the evil angels have lost.
Therefore Satan envies them, and wants to ruin them
by every means in his power. The chief means is mortal
sin, by which a man joins in with the tempter in
rebelling against his Sovereign Lord. If Satan cannot
succeed in leading us into mortal sin, he will strive to
impair at least the beauty of the soul by venial sin, and
worry it to deprive it of the peace of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>God allows all this to happen that man may be
further ennobled by his victories over temptations and
be more richly rewarded; also that the power of the
Lord may be more and more manifested, when He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>enables so weak a being as man to triumph over such
powerful spirits. Thus Providence draws good out of
evil, and the wisdom, power, and goodness of God are
glorified, virtue is perfected in infirmity (<abbr title='second'>II</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>,
9), and the free creature is exalted. This is beautifully
explained in the book of Tobias: “Thy counsel
is not in man’s power. But this every man is sure of
that worshippeth thee, that his life, if it be under trial,
shall be crowned; and if it be under tribulation it shall
be delivered, and if it be under correction, it shall be
allowed to come to thy mercy: because after a storm,
thou makest a calm, and after tears and weeping thou
pourest in joyfulness. Be thy name, O God of Israel,
blessed forever” (<abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 20-23).</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='two'>II</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'><i>All must expect to be tried by temptations</i>; for the
Lord assures us: “the kingdom of heaven suffereth
violence and the violent bear it away” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>,
12); now our indolence tempts us to shirk this violence.
Our Blessed Saviour allowed Himself to be tempted,
and we are to be made like unto Him: “The disciple is
not above his master” (ib. <abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 24). Those who aim at
a closer resemblance to their Divine Master must expect
to be more violently tempted; and therefore Ecclesiasticus
warns us: “Son, when thou comest to the
service of God, stand in justice and in fear, and prepare
thy soul for temptation. Humble thy heart and endure”
(<abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 1). In fact those who please God must be
tempted; the two things are inseparable, as the Angel
explained to Tobias: “Because thou wast acceptable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>to God, it was necessary that temptation should prove
thee” (<abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>, 13). Read the lives of the Saints, and
you will not find one who had not to endure severe
temptations, from <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul and the other Apostles down
to the latest Saint.</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='three'>III</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'><i>God will not allow us to be tempted above our
strength</i>, as He has graciously promised through <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Paul, who writes: “God is faithful, who will not
allow you to be tempted above that which you are able,
but will make also with temptation issue that you may
be able to bear it” (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 13). This truth is strikingly
illustrated by the history of Job, which is graphically
told thus, in poetic language: “On a certain day,
when the sons of God came to stand before the Lord,
Satan also was present among them. And the Lord
said to him: Hast thou considered my servant Job,
that there is none like him in the earth, a simple and upright
man, and fearing God and avoiding evil? And
Satan answering said: Does Job fear God in vain?
Hast thou not made a fence for him and his house, and
all his substance round about, blessed the work of his
hands, and his possession hath increased on the earth?
But stretch forth thy hand a little, and touch all that he
hath, and see if he blesseth thee not to thy face.
Then the Lord said to Satan: Behold all that he hath
is in thy hand, only put not forth thy hand upon his
person.” He thus allowed Satan to deprive Job of his
possessions, but not to go any further. We all know
how Satan carried out this permission to the letter, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>took away in one day all that Job enjoyed, his sons and
daughters included, so that he exclaimed: “Naked
came I out of my mother’s womb, and naked shall I
return thither, the Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken
away; as it hath pleased to the Lord so it is done,” and
he added with perfect resignation: “Blessed be the
name of the Lord” (<abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 6-22). Next, Satan obtains
power from God to afflict Job in his health, yet so as to
spare his life; God controls all. “So Satan went forth
from the face of the Lord, and struck Job with a very
grievous ulcer, from the sole of the foot to the top of
his head. And he took a potsherd, and scraped the corrupt
matter, sitting on a dunghill. And his wife said
to him: Dost thou still continue in thy simplicity?
bless God and die, and he said to her: Thou hast
spoken like one of the foolish women; if we have received
good things at the hand of God, why should we
not receive evil? In all these things Job did not sin
with his lips” (<abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 7, 8).</p>

<p class='c007'>Such is the grand example of patience that Job gave
for all subsequent ages. After his trials were ended,
the Lord rewarded him abundantly in his wealth and
in the excellence of his later children; “and Job lived
after these things a hundred and forty years, and he
saw his children and his children’s children unto the
fourth generation, and he died an old man and full of
years.” In the New Law, in which we live, the rewards
of patience are far more precious than those
here mentioned in the case of Job; for “The sufferings
of this time,” says <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul, “are not worthy to be compared
with the glory to come that shall be revealed in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>us” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii,</abbr> 18). And <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James writes: “Blessed
is the man that endureth temptations; for when he hath
been proved, he shall receive the crown of life which
God hath promised to them that love Him” (<abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 12).</p>
<h4 class='c012'><abbr title='four'>IV</abbr></h4>
<p class='c006'>We must remember, however, that <i>not all our temptations
are from the evil spirit</i>. He is wicked enough
to cause them all; but he need not do so. Of course
they never come from God; for <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James says: “Let
no man, when he is tempted, say that he is tempted
by God; for God is not a tempter of evils, and He
tempts no man. But every man is tempted by his
own concupiscence, being drawn away and allured”
(<abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 13-14).</p>

<p class='c007'>As concupiscence belongs to our fallen nature, it cannot
be altogether suppressed; but its power can be very
much increased or diminished; and therefore the temptations
it causes are to a considerable extent under our
own control. If a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Aloysius, a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Stanislaus and
many other chaste youths scarcely felt any rebellions of
the flesh, it was due in great part to the care with which
they had from their early childhood guarded the gates
of their senses, their eyes, their ears, their touch; and
instead of flattering them, they had constantly mortified
them in various ways. On the other hand, very many
persons allow themselves liberties of an indelicate nature;
these need not wonder why they find it so difficult
to lead chaste lives.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, even the most mortified souls may be
severely tempted to carnal sins; thus we read of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Anthony, that, even in his frightful desert, he was one
day assailed by such temptations; and when the victory
was won, he exclaimed: Lord where wast Thou when
those vile images beset my mind? And the Lord answered
him: Anthony, I was in the midst of your
heart. But the danger of the sin is certainly much
greater when a person is, partly at least, the cause of
such disorderly affections, when he heaps fuel on the
fire of concupiscence.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is well to ask oneself in a retreat: have I anything
to reproach myself with in this respect? How do I
habitually observe modesty of the eyes in public and in
private? Is my reading always proper and prudent?
Do I ever indulge indolence or excessive softness?
am I perfectly temperate in food and drink, and thus
cautious not to arouse dangerous passions? It is necessary
to ask the Lord frequently and fervently:
“Lead us not into temptation”; but this will be of little
avail if we bring on temptations by our own laxity or
imprudence.</p>
<h3 id='day6-m3' class='c011'>THE THIRD MEDITATION <br> On the Three Classes of men</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you behold Christ before you,
looking kindly upon you, and saying: “My son, give
me thy heart” (<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='thirty-three'>xxxiii</abbr>).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask fervently for light to understand
this gracious invitation, and strength to comply with it
generously.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> While this invitation is really addressed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>by our loving Lord to every man, consider how differently
it is responded to by various classes of men.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The first class</i>, which unfortunately is very numerous,
turn a deaf ear to this appeal. They are so taken
up with the vanities or the pleasures of the world, with
the pursuit of riches or honor or friendships, that they
do not even stop to consider the call of grace. The
turmoil of their passions drowns the still voice of conscience,
and they rush on to the yawning abyss of eternal
loss. Let me thank the Lord that He has prevented
me by His loving care from running along in
this mad career.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> The second class of men listen to the
Divine call, appreciate its infinite condescension, fly
from the allurements of the grossest vices, and give
their hearts to their Sovereign Master. Yet they do
not give their whole heart. A part of it is occupied by
some cherished creature, which they will not sacrifice
to their loving Lord. We read that when <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Sebastian
was trying to convert a Roman nobleman, named
Croatius, he promised him a cure from a painful disease
as soon as he should receive Baptism; for Sebastian
worked many miracles. But he required as a
necessary condition that Croatius should destroy all the
idols he had in his house. After the Baptism the convert
complained that his sickness was not removed. It
was found that he had not destroyed one little idol of
gold, an old heirloom in the family; and only after this
also was given up was the cure obtained. Thus very
many souls are kept back from perfection by some cherished
idol which they hesitate to resign.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>In the world some men are estimable citizens, honest,
charitable, but neglectful of religious duties; others are
even practical Catholics, except that they neglect Confession.
All such are in evident danger of dying in
their sins and being lost forever; but passion blinds
them to their terrible danger. Among religious no
great vice is common, but many are held back from attaining
perfection by some human attachment, or by
some evil habit, which they refuse, or hesitate to abandon
altogether.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is there any sacrifice that I know, or at least suspect,
my dear Lord asks of me? Is there any practice or
habit of mine that may not please Him? If a sculptor,
carving an elegant statue, would find a flaw in the
marble that would disfigure the countenance, he might
have to reject that stone and choose another. The
Divine Artist is forming my soul into an image of
Christ; happily, if He finds a flaw in my soul, He can
remove it, but He will not do so without my consent;
or rather He will not remove it Himself, but aid me to
remove it. Is there such a flaw? Are there perhaps
more than one? Speak, O Lord, Thy servant heareth.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>The third class of men</i> to whom the
Lord says, “Son, give me thy heart,” answer promptly
and generously: “O Lord! I wish to be all thine”;
“For what have I in Heaven? and besides Thee what
do I desire upon earth? For Thee my flesh and my
heart hath fainted away; Thou art the God of my heart,
and the God that is my portion forever” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 72).
But of course virtue does not consist in fine sentiments
alone. Docile to the invitation of Christ, we must so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>give Him our hearts that we are willing to satisfy all
His desires. “What shall I render to the Lord for all
the things that He hath rendered to me?” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 115).</p>

<p class='c007'>I am now come to the end of the second week of the
Exercises. Its main purpose was the study of Christ’s
private and public life, so as to make myself like unto
Him. This therefore is the proper time to examine
whether there is any trait of my Divine model which I
am not yet determined to reproduce in my own soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius introduces the election of a state
of life for those who have not yet entered on a permanent
career; and from those who have he expects a
reformation of life. Now this is best accomplished by
comparing our own hearts with that of our Divine pattern,
taking most generous resolutions to remove all
flaws and supply all deficiencies.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> O my dear Mother Mary! I beg of thee
to obtain for me from thy Divine Son the grace of following
His example in the practice of all the virtues,
doing whatever He may desire of me and that at any
sacrifice. Oh, dearest Lord! by Thy love for Thy
Blessed Mother, obtain for me, this precious grace from
Thy Heavenly Father. And Thou, my Supreme Lord
and Master, God the Father, grant me this entire devotedness
at the prayer of Thy Divine Son.</p>
<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>
  <h2 id='day7' class='c005'>THE SEVENTH DAY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>Here we begin the Third Week of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius’
Exercises; it is devoted to the consideration of Christ’s
sacred passion. These meditations, or contemplations,
are a tribute of love that we offer to our dear Lord; and
they are suggestive to ourselves of generous sentiments,
and earnest resolutions to practise even heroic virtue,
in following our beloved King to the height of His self-sacrifice.
By the light and grace they impart, they aid
us to advance rapidly in the way of perfection.</p>

<p class='c007'>We read in the Life and Revelations of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Gertrude
(<abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 348) that she beheld one day our Blessed Lord as
He was after He had been whipped at the pillar,
covered with wounds, and she asked Him, tenderly:
“Alas, Lord, what remedy can we find to sooth Thy
agonizing pains?” Our Lord replied: “The most
efficacious and tenderest remedy you can prepare for
Me is to meditate on My passion, and to pray charitably
for the conversion of sinners.” It is in this spirit that
all the exercises of this day should be performed.</p>
<h3 id='day7-m1' class='c011'>THE FIRST MEDITATION <br> On the Sufferings of Christ in the Garden</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Read the <abbr title='twenty-sixth'>26th</abbr> chapter of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Matthew’s
Gospel, from the <abbr title='thirtieth'>30th</abbr> to the <abbr title='fifty-seventh'>57th</abbr> verse.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold Christ prostrate in the prayer
of His agony.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg grace to condole with Him and
to suffer patiently and generously.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider Christ’s entrance into the garden.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The persons</i>: Christ, my Saviour, goes to suffer for
me. The fact then regards me personally, I cannot be
indifferent to its details. He selects Peter, John and
James to witness His agony. Thus the severest trials
come to God’s favorites. Christ has prepared them for
this trial of their faith by the vision of His glory
on Mount Thabor. Thus He provides special aids
for special difficulties. All the Apostles have been
strengthened for the occasion by Holy Communion.
A fall soon after receiving Communion does not prove
an unworthy Communion.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The words.</i> Peter said: “Although all should be
scandalized in thee, I will never be scandalized.”
Pride goes before a fall. “Jesus said to him: Amen,
I say to thee that, before the cock crow, thou shalt deny
me thrice.” Christ saith to his Apostles: “My soul
is sorrowful even unto death.” We should not then
be discouraged if we shrink from suffering, and are
saddened by them.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The actions.</i> Jesus prepares for the conflict by betaking
Himself to prayer. I must do the same in
trials.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>The agony.</i> <i>The words</i>: “My
Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me.
Nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt.” It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>then perfectly proper to pray for deliverance from the
cross; but we must ever add submission to God’s
holy will: “Not my will but thine be done.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The actions</i>: “He cometh to his disciples, and findeth
them asleep.” We are not then forbidden to seek
for consolation from our fellow-men; but we shall
usually be disappointed; like Jesus, we must return to
prayer. He prayed again, “saying the self-same
words.” We should not try to be eloquent in prayer,
but dwell on a few thoughts or sentiments. We can
have no better model of prayer than we have here
before us. The Apostles neglected their opportunity;
hence their cowardice.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. The treason of Judas. The persons.</i>
The Son of God is meanly betrayed by one of His own
Apostles. How is the gold obscured! When favorite
souls fall away, they often fall the deepest. How did
he come to this? From small beginnings, by little
thefts at first. One passion left unchecked is enough
to ruin the noblest character. All the passions are in
every one of us, and need constant watching.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The words.</i> “Hail Rabbi.” What hypocrisy!
“Friend, whereunto art thou come?” Christ still
loved the wretch, and kindly wished to bring him back
to his duty. That is the charity of my model. Is
mine like His?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The actions.</i> He receives the kiss of the traitor and
shows no indignation. Then Christ lets Himself be
seized and bound like a criminal, and He abandons
Himself into the hands of His enemies, recognizing in
them the executers of His Father’s will. “Then the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>disciples, all leaving him, fled”; and yet all of them had
said with Peter that they were ready to go with Him
even to death. It is not boasting, but praying we need.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i>, thanking our dear Lord for His generous
love for us, asking that we may know and love Him
better and follow Him more perfectly.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Notice</i> that the thoughts here expressed are only
suggestions and need not be entertained. The exercitant
is apt to be most benefited by what he discovers
himself. And when a thought or sentiment strikes
him, he should dwell on it as long as it gives him devotion,
and not hasten on to other matters.</p>
<h3 id='day7-m2' class='c011'>THE SECOND MEDITATION <br> On Christ’s Sufferings before His Judges</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Christ was dragged from court to
court, everywhere loaded with false accusations; but
He opened not His mouth. He was dressed in a
fool’s garment, cruelly scourged and crowned with
thorns, and bore all patiently. Exposed to the sight of
the multitude, He saw a robber preferred to Him, was
rejected by His people and condemned to the death of
the cross.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold Christ with His hands tied
like a criminal, standing before the tribunal of Caiphas.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> My dear Lord, grant me deep sorrow
for Thy sufferings and for my sins, by which I have
repaid Thy infinite love.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Christ is falsely accused.</i> Consider:</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The persons.</i> The judges presume to sit in judgment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>on Him who has proved Himself to be the Son
of God. Our sins, like theirs, are often far more serious
than we are willing to acknowledge to ourselves.
We blind ourselves. Caiphas did so by claiming that
it was “expedient that one man should die for the
people, and that the whole nation perish not” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John
<abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 50). This was true, but not in the sense the high
priest gave to it. Do I ever judge my neighbor unjustly?
perhaps even my superiors?</p>

<p class='c007'>The witnesses little think how wicked their accusations
are, leading to the crime of deicide: “The tongue
is a fire, a world of iniquity” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James <abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 6). Meanwhile
Christ is silent, to teach us how to suffer; silence
under accusations, true or false, is usually better than
the most eloquent defense. Isaias had predicted:
“He shall be dumb as a lamb before his hearers, and
he shall not open his mouth” (<abbr title='fifty-one'>liii</abbr>, 7). He only spoke
when the honor of God required it, as when the high
priest said: “I conjure thee by the living God that
thou tell us if thou be the Christ, the Son of God.
Jesus said to them: Thou has said it. Nevertheless
I say to you, hereafter you shall see the son of man
sitting on the right hand of the power of God and
coming in the clouds of Heaven. They answering
said: He is guilty of death” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi</abbr>, 63-66).
What injustice! This is often repeated to-day
by those who hate the Church; we must wait patiently
for the time of its glorification.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Dressed in a fool’s garment, scourged,
crowned with thorns.</i> Behold the humiliations, the
cruel sufferings patiently endured by the Redeemer, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>an expiation of your own sins. Try to realize the details
of the torments heaped upon Him. That flagellation
was borne to expiate sins of the body. Do I
practise bodily mortification enough? Soft members
are out of place in the mystic body of Christ. He is
crowned with thorns; do I look for honors and laurel
crowns? He is decked in mockery with a rag of purple;
do I delight in vain display? Lord, make me like
unto thee.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> Pilate shows Him to the people:
<span lang="la">“<i>Ecco homo</i>,”</span> “Behold the man.” Let me observe
Him well, noticing every indignity inflicted on Him.
His head crowned with thorns, His face defiled with
spittle, every visible portion of His sacred body livid
with bruises and stained with clotted blood: “A worm
and no man, the reproach of men and the outcast of
the people” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 21), “Despised and the most abject
of men, a man of sorrows” (<abbr title='Isaiah'>Is.</abbr> <abbr title='fifty-three'>liii</abbr>, 3).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The words</i>: “Give us Barabbas and take Jesus
away.” How can I complain when others are preferred
to me? “Let him be crucified”; “His blood be
upon us and upon our children.” How fearfully has
this curse been carried into effect. Behold the whole
Jewish race struck with spiritual blindness for already
nineteen centuries, in the midst of nations blest with
the light of faith. How this ruin of His nation must
have grieved the heart of the Redeemer. Pilate vainly
tries to disclaim his responsibility for the deicide: “I
am innocent of the death of this just man.” So we
may deceive ourselves, wilfully. Am I always honest
in my pretences?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span><i>The actions.</i> Pilate delivers Christ to be crucified.
This is the price paid for every soul, the death of
Christ. How precious is a soul! The blood of Christ
is the atonement of sin; what a terrible evil is sin!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with Jesus, as He stands there condemned
to an ignominious death; indulging the sentiments
aroused by the meditation.</p>
<h3 id='day7-c' class='c011'>CONSIDERATION <br> On Generosity in the Service of God</h3>
<p class='c006'>When we performed the meditation on the Kingdom
of Christ, we imagined a very noble prince, who, at
the call of God, abandoned all other pursuits to devote
himself to the establishment of the Kingdom of God
on earth, and summoned all brave souls to rally under
his standard for this exalted purpose. We next considered
that this parable was not a mere creation of the
fancy, but was a fit expression of a grand reality. For
such a noble prince did actually appear on earth, one
far nobler than we could have conceived possible, the
Son of God Himself, come down to establish the Kingdom
of His Father in the hearts of men, and thus prepare
them to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. At
this summons we resolved to follow Him, and we have
really left all things for that purpose, and our highest
ambition now is to follow Him most closely by making
ourselves as like to Him as, with God’s grace, may be
possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>To accomplish this purpose, we have been studying
His example, from the moment of His incarnation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>through His birth, childhood, His private and His public
life, till we have seen Him deliver Himself into the
hands of His enemies, submit to the most shocking
indignities and torments; and all this through love
for us, paying the penalties of our sins in His own
Person, to save us from Hell and make us share His
glory. The most appropriate term to express all
this devotedness is “boundless generosity.” This is
the most striking characteristic of our glorious
King.</p>

<p class='c007'>As we are earnestly striving to make ourselves like to
Him, we will now consider the excellence of the virtue
of generosity; and we do so by preference on this day
on which we are meditating on the sacrifices by which
Christ’s generosity was exhibited in the most impressive
manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among natural qualities in man generosity is the
noblest, among the supernatural virtues it is the highest,
because it is the most Godlike. Charity, the love
of God, and of the neighbor for the love of God, is
the most perfect virtue, and generosity is the perfection
of charity. The highest manifestation that God
has made of Himself is twofold, the creation and the
incarnation with all its consequences. He created to
pour out happiness on other beings, all manners of
good things on created natures; He became incarnate
to bestow <i>Himself</i> on them; and He did so even after
they had forfeited their primal destiny. Thus too a
man by the practice of generosity gives of his own to
others, by supernatural generosity he gives himself entirely
to God and to others for the sake of God.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>When we give to our neighbor what we owe him, we
practise the virtue of justice; when we give to God
the honor we owe Him, we practise the virtue of religion,
which is a species of justice; but we practice the
virtue of generosity when we give more than the Lord
demands of us, and thereby we more closely resemble
God, on whom we have no claim and who yet gave us
all we have.</p>

<p class='c007'>The proper esteem, as well as the practice of this
virtue, is taught us by the grand mysteries on which
we meditate to-day. In fact these lessons have been
excellently learned by the followers of Christ throughout
all the ages of Christianity. See how His Apostles,
to a man, gave their whole lives and finally shed
their blood, as Jesus had done, for the honor of God,
and the salvation of souls.</p>

<p class='c007'>The same was done by thousands of other followers
in after generations and is continued to be done till the
present day. Countless solitaries of both sexes, and
monks and nuns and missionaries among the heathens
have left all things and thus imitated the generosity of
the Redeemer. Sacrifice for the same glorious cause is
written large over the history of the Church in every
age and every land.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is this spirit of generous sacrifice that we must
to-day rekindle in our hearts. We should not now
ask ourselves merely, as we did properly some days
ago, is there any sacrifice I <i>am bound</i> to make if I want
to save my immortal soul? but, at the sight of Jesus
mocked and scourged, and crowned with thorns and
dying like a criminal upon the cross, and all this for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>my sins, let me ask myself generously, “what sacrifices
<i>can</i> I make to God to show my gratitude?”</p>

<p class='c007'>These sentiments aroused in <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, as under
the guidance of the Holy Spirit he performed the
Spiritual Exercises at Manresa, an ambition beautifully
expressed in the motto he selected for his Society <span lang="la"><i>Ad
Majorem Dei Gloriam</i></span>, “For the Greater Glory of
God.” For he became so enraptured with the love of
Christ that he longed only to sacrifice himself entirely
for the honor of God, and to rally around him a generous
band of men who should be aglow with the same
Divine enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c007'>This spirit of generosity, so characteristic of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Ignatius, is clearly manifested in the Constitutions
which he drew up for the guidance and the government
of his Society. The whole spirit of his institute
is a spirit of generous devotion to the service of God
and the good of men. For instance, he wants his followers
to be so little attached to their country, or to
any place whatever, that they shall be willing to go
and live in any part of the world where there is hope of
God’s greater service and the help of souls. They must
leave father and mother, sisters and brothers and whatsoever
they had in the world. They must so far resign
their right to a good name as to allow all their
errors and defects to be manifested to their superiors.
They are even urged to wish to suffer reproaches,
slanders and injuries, and to be treated and accounted
as fools, so as to resemble Jesus Christ, and in all things
to seek their greater abnegation and continual mortification.
In the exercise of low and mean offices they
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>must be willing to be employed in such as are more
abhorrent to nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Certainly all these rules and practices suppose an uncommon
degree of generosity. And yet the Saint insists
on them, and urges his followers to labor constantly
that no point of perfection which by God’s grace
they can attain in the perfect observance of his Constitutions,
be omitted by them. In all things they are
to seek God, casting off, as much as is possible, the love
of creatures, that they may set all their affections on
the Creator.</p>

<p class='c007'>As to the general spirit of his Society, it is hard to
conceive how this could be more generous than it actually
is; and no less generosity is seen when the rules
descend to practical details. Consider, for instance,
the strict interpretation they put on the understanding
of the religious vows. They make poverty a total
privation of the right to dispose of anything at one’s
will or discretion, neither allowing one to give nor to
receive, to lend nor to borrow any object whatever without
permission of the superior.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the measure and the pattern of the vow of
chastity nothing less is proposed than the purity of the
blessed Angels in Heaven. To protect this virtue a
Jesuit has to submit himself all the days of his life to
such careful surveillance as solicitous parents exercise
over their daughters, who are not allowed to go outside
the house without permission, nor, as far as circumstances
allow, without the attendance of a discreet
companion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is especially with regard to the vow and the virtue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>of obedience that generosity is carried to its highest
perfection. Not only every command of a superior is
to be obeyed, but even every hint of his will is to be
complied with, every token of his wishes; and this is
to be done promptly, without excuse, without reluctance
of the will, without disagreement of the judgment.
And in all these observances no one can claim exemption
or privilege on account of high offices formerly
held, on account of great learning or unusual ability
or for any other consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>With such precepts and examples before me, what
can I do better than to lead henceforth a life of constant
generosity? Let me pause to consider carefully
and prayerfully what sacrifices in particular I can offer.
Speak, Lord! Thy servant heareth; there is
nothing I will refuse. Give me the grace of doing
what Thou desirest, and ask what Thou wilt.</p>

<p class='c007'>When our Divine Lord appeared to five of His
Apostles after His resurrection, He took <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter
aside and asked him: “Simon, son of John, lovest
thou me more than these? He saith to him: Yea
Lord, thou knowest that I love thee; He saith to him:
Feed my lambs—Feed my sheep.” As if He had said:
You cannot show Me your love better than by feeding
My lambs and My sheep. And thus we too cannot
give to Christ a more acceptable proof of our love
than that of working for the salvation of souls, the
lambs and sheep for which He shed the last drop of
His sacred blood. How am I performing that holy
task? The question just now is not: am I doing my
full duty in the exercise of the sacred ministry? but,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>can I do any more than I have done so far, or than
I am actually doing for the good of immortal souls?
Can I undertake any more work and remain within
the bounds of discretion? Or at least can I perform
my tasks with more care and devotedness? And can
I pray more fervently to draw down God’s blessing
on my labors?</p>

<p class='c007'>There is still another way in which we can successfully
exercise our zeal for souls, namely by praying and
working for the increase of the number of laborers
in Christ’s vineyard. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Matthew tells us that, “Seeing
the multitudes Christ had compassion on them, because
they were distressed and lying like sheep that
have no shepherd. Then he said to his disciples:
The harvest indeed is great, but the laborers are few.
Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest that he send
laborers into his harvest” (<abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>, 36-38).</p>

<p class='c007'>Undoubtedly such prayers are daily going up to
Heaven asking for more sacred laborers, and in response
God is constantly furnishing His Church with
new accessions to the number of her ministers. If our
prayers were more abundant and more fervent and our
efforts more earnest, we could obtain still more. Here
too is room for more generous exertions.</p>
<h3 id='day7-m3' class='c011'>THE THIRD MEDITATION <br> On the Death of Christ</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Christ carried His cross a weary way
up the mountain, falling repeatedly beneath it. Arrived
at the top, He is despoiled of His garments, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>stands there a pillar of bleeding flesh. He is most
rudely nailed to the cross, which is next lifted up, and
dropped with a shock into its socket. His hands
and feet are torn around the nails. He exclaims:
“Father, forgive them,” says to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John: “Behold
thy mother,” exclaims “Father, into thy hands I commend
my Spirit!” and expires. His sacred Heart is
pierced.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold Christ hanging on the cross,
amid the jeers of His triumphant enemies. He is
praying for us all.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg for a loving compassion for His
pains and for a deep sorrow for sin.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider how Christ painfully carries
His cross. He thus shows us the one way to Heaven,
that of suffering. There would have been another
way, that of innocence, by which the Angels had entered;
but it was closed by the sin of Adam and by
our own sins. Now we must all suffer, here or hereafter.
The lookers on were of three classes: His
enemies, rejoicing; His friends sorrowing; the crowd,
indifferent. It is so to-day. The falls of Christ represent
our moral falls; these must humble, but not
discourage us. He meets His blessed Mother: sufferings
bring us nearer to Mary. Condole with her.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Christ is despoiled of His garments,
that He may die in the utmost poverty, in which He
has also been born. His clothes cling to His torn
flesh, and are removed with no tender hands. He
bleeds again at every pore. He is rudely thrown down
on the cross; watch the process of the nailing, of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>raising of the cross, of its dropping into the hole
with a rude shock, His sacred flesh tearing about the
nails. He exclaims: “Father, forgive them, for they
know not what they do.” What charity! What an
example for us His followers! Again He speaks:
“Woman, behold thy son,” “Behold thy mother.” <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
John, the only one of the Apostles present, represented
the Church; in his person we were all commended to
Mary by her dying Son, and we were bidden to hold
her as our Mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Christ hung there on the cross, He viewed and
read the hearts of all men, for whom He died; He
thought of me in person. He exclaimed: “Father,
into thy hands I commend my spirit!” and He expired.
Let me resign myself into the hands of God with
humble, loving confidence. Let me thank the Lord
for His most precious death, repent of my sins, which
required such expiation, and pray that sinners may be
converted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Let me lovingly kiss the cross, and in spirit bend
my head beneath the stream of His sacred blood, to
wash away my sins.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sacred heart of Jesus is next pierced with a
lance, to open that sanctuary for me and for all sinners.
Let me adore that Divine Heart, and promise to
love and honor it, and teach others to do the same.</p>

  <h2 id='day8' class='c005'>THE EIGHTH DAY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c006'>So far we have followed our King, Jesus Christ,
through His humiliations, labors and sufferings from
His incarnation to His cruel death; we must now follow
Him in His glorified life. There too He is still
our leader, by whose side we must triumph, as we have
fought by His side. We must now rejoice with
Him. For joy at His exaltation is worship; and at
the same time it encourages us to follow Him generously
and lovingly and to persevere to the end. Such
is the purpose of the Fourth Week of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius’s
Exercises.</p>
<h3 id='day8-m1' class='c011'>THE FIRST MEDITATION <br> On the Resurrection of Christ</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> The soul of Christ, accompanied by
the holy souls from Limbo, comes to the tomb. He
arises glorious. The holy women come to annoint the
body. “He is not here.” Christ appears to His
Blessed Mother, to the penitent Magdalen, to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter,
to the devout women.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold the glorified body of the
Saviour, as He arises from the tomb. Imagine the
scene.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask to rejoice with Him for His own
sake, and to be thereby encouraged to suffer like Him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Behold the scene of His resurrection.
First see the lifeless body, with its gaping wounds and
discolored flesh. In union with the blessed souls,
adore it. Then as Christ’s soul enters it, behold how
it is transformed. How different He is now from
“the man of sorrows”!  His sacred countenance beams
with happiness. Recall His former transfiguration on
Mount Thabor: “His face did shine as the sun, and
His garments became white as snow.” On His head
there is still a crown, but no more of thorns, but now
one of glory. His sacred wounds are in His hands
and feet and in His side, but they drip no more with
blood, but pour forth rays of light. Bow down in loving
adoration, and in spirit humbly kiss His feet, and
adore your sovereign Lord. Ask Him to bless you,
and to strengthen you to follow in His footsteps.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Imagine you see the blessed souls proceed,
in company with Christ, to visit the cross, on
which He expiated the sins of the world. Adore the
cross, and kiss it lovingly. Bow down and kiss the
spot on which He was nailed to the tree. Next, retracing
the way of the cross, meditate lovingly on His
various sufferings.</p>

<p class='c007'>At last accompany the Lord in spirit as He goes to
visit and console His Blessed Mother. There behold
her still seated in the deepest affliction, the Mother of
Sorrows, plunged in an agony of grief, like that which
had made the Saviour exclaim: “Father, if it be possible
let this chalice pass from me.” When suddenly
a soft radiance fills the room, and, as she looks up, she
sees before her the glorified form of her Divine Son.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>Pause to share in her exceeding joy and love and
gratitude. Remember that thus your sufferings too
will one day be exchanged for boundless bliss.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> Consider how meanwhile the pious
women were hastening, at early dawn, on their way
from the city to the tomb, carrying with them precious
ointments to embalm more perfectly the sacred body of
their Lord. They ask one another as they approach
the sacred spot: “Who shall roll us back the stone
from the door of the sepulchre? And looking they
saw the stone rolled back. For it was very great”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 3).</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus it is that we often see difficulties before us,
and we see no way of escape; but a kind Providence
brings us unexpected help: “I can do all things in him
who strengtheneth me” wrote <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul (<abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 13).
We should not be too timid when we work for the
glory of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still the holy women are not favored with the sight
of the Saviour, but they are sent by the Angel with a
message to the Apostles; in due time Jesus will reward
their devotion. “And behold Jesus met them,
saying, All hail, But they came up and took hold of
his feet and adored him” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-eight'>xxviii</abbr>, 9).
This favor was the reward of their loving service.
Oh! that we could serve the Redeemer as they did!
We can do so by honoring Him in the Blessed Sacrament,
visiting Him there, adorning His altars. We
can also do it by serving the poor: “Amen, I say to
you: as long as you did it to one of these my least
brethren, you did it to me” (<abbr title='Ibid'>Ib.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv</abbr>, 40).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>The Lord has His own sweet way of encouraging
us. Before appearing to those pious women, He appeared
first to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mary Magdalen, out of whom He
has cast seven devils; then He appeared to Simon
Peter, who had foresworn Him. Truly Christ had
come on earth to save sinners; none of us should ever
despond.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>A loving colloquy</i> with our dear Lord, adoring Him,
congratulating Him on His triumphs, in spirit embracing
His sacred feet, begging for grace to walk in His
blessed footsteps till we too partake of His glory.</p>
<h3 id='day8-m2' class='c011'>THE SECOND MEDITATION<br> On Christ’s Ascension into Heaven</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Read Acts, <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 1-11.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold the scene on Mount Olivet,
Christ rising above the crowd of His disciples, every
one of whom looks lovingly upwards, enraptured by
the sight of His triumph.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg to rejoice for Christ’s sake, and
to be encouraged to follow your King faithfully to
the end.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider 1. <i>The Persons</i>: Christ,
the former “Man of Sorrows,” now the conqueror of
death, the glorified Lord of Heaven. He is still our
King, leading the army of His followers into the
Kingdom of His Father. I must follow Him on earth,
that I may follow Him into Heaven. By His side
stands His blessed Mother, how exultant now in His
triumph! There is the Magdalen, rapt in an ecstasy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>of joy; <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Peter, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John, all His dearest friends, rejoicing
at the blissful vision.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>The actions.</i> Christ is ascending Heavenwards,
going to take possession of His Kingdom.
All His disciples raise their eyes and their hands
towards His ascending form, and experience a foretaste
of that happiness which is to be their eternal reward.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>The circumstances.</i> Where does Christ ascend?
In sight of Calvary. When? But a few weeks after
His dreadful death. So too will our trials come to
an early end, much earlier perhaps than we anticipate.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Consider Christ’s entrance into
Heaven amid the adoring and exulting choirs of the
entire angelic host, and proceeding to occupy the most
magnificent of all thrones, prepared for Him at the
right hand of His Father. Then began a bliss not less
real than His sufferings had been, with a joy ever
ancient and ever new, and destined to last for all
eternity. Happy souls, redeemed by His sacred death,
and purified in His precious blood, are flocking in
from every clime, and are received to His loving embrace.
What ecstasy! Shall I ever reach that goal?
It is destined for me. Jesus is the King whom I am
serving. He knows me, He loves me, He beckons
me on.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> Look around that blissful abode.
Who are there? All the truly good of every generation.
There, on that bright throne nearest to Jesus
is His Blessed Mother Mary, the queen of Heaven and
earth, the refuge of sinners, the help of Christians, my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>loving Mother. Kneeling in spirit at her feet I will
ask for perseverance in her service. There are my
blessed patrons, whom I have honored on earth, now
ready to welcome me to their happy company. Holy
Saints of God, pray for me! There are many blessed
souls whom I knew in the days of their own trials on
earth, my parents and relatives and fellow-religious,
and some perhaps whom I have benefited in life, or
after their death in Purgatory.</p>

<p class='c007'>All look down on me with loving eyes, and bid me
persevere and improve further in fervor of life; for
“The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory to come, which shall be revealed
in us” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii,</abbr> 18).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>.</i> Consider the words of the two Angels:
“Why stand you looking up to heaven? This Jesus
who is taken up from you into heaven shall so come
as you have seen him going into heaven.” For this
second coming of the Lord we must now prepare by
active work. The days of the retreat will soon be
past, we must return to the daily drudgery of life;
but we must do so with a renewed spirit of genuine
devotion. We must prepare like the Prudent Virgins:
“At midnight there was a cry made: Behold, the
bridegroom cometh, go ye forth to meet him—And
they that were ready went in with him to the marriage”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv</abbr>, 6-10).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Address our dear Lord lovingly, joyfully,
congratulating Him on His triumph, and begging
for a generous spirit of sacrifice in His service.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>
  <h3 id='day8-c' class='c011'>CONSIDERATION <br> On the Spirit of Love</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>The ultimate purpose of the Spiritual Exercises of
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, is to make us serve God in the most perfect
manner possible, and therefore in the spirit of
love, or charity: “Now there remain faith, hope, and
charity; these three, but the greater of these is charity”
(<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>, 13). Love is the most excellent
homage that the creature can render to the Creator.
Behold the bee in the springtime issuing from its hive
and soaring afar over the sunny fields. It is in quest
of honey: Honey is all it cares for. It passes by
the velvet pansy, the flaming tulip, and lights with
eagerness on the humble clover, because it finds honey
there. Thus too some men prize and seek nothing
but riches, others only honor, others pleasure, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>What can there be in this vast material universe that
God would deign to care for? It is love of the human
heart. It is His delight to be with the children of
men, as He tells us in the Book of Proverbs: “My
delights to be with the children of men” (<abbr title='eight'>viii</abbr>, 31).
And what does the Lord desire from men? He states
it further on: “My son, give me thy heart” (<abbr title='Ibid'>Ib.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii</abbr>,
26); that is, of course, thy love; for the heart of man
is the emblem of love. Without love nothing has
value in God’s eyes, as the Apostle proclaims so eloquently
in his First Epistle to the Corinthians: “If
I should distribute all my goods to the poor, and I
should deliver my body to be burned, and have not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>charity, it profiteth me nothing” (<abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>, 3). This charity
is so pleasing to Heaven because it comes from
Heaven; it is Divine: “The charity of God is poured
forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who is given
to us” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 5). Of course, our love of God is
no benefit to Him, no more than the love of a little
child for its parents is any profit to them. The infant
causes any amount of inconvenience and trouble
in the home. Its loving looks and tender caresses are
all it can give in return for the kindness shown it; but
this is sufficient in the eyes of affectionate parents.
We are like infants before the Lord, we can give Him
nothing that He stands in need of, all He desires of us
is that we love Him; and this very love He turns to
our own advantage, for He rewards it most richly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Besides this reward, there is another advantage derived
from loving God, namely that love lightens all
burdens of life. Why does a young mother, formerly
rapped up in the pursuit of pleasure, now sit so patiently
for hours by the bedside of her ailing child,
forgetful of all worldly amusements,—except because
she loves that infant. Love makes all efforts pleasing;
as Thomas à Kempis puts it: <span lang="la"><i>Facile equitat quem
gratia Dei portat</i></span>, “He rides along with ease who is
borne up by the grace of God.” So if we are animated
by the love of God, we rejoice in serving Him,
we hunger and thirst after justice. And this cheerful
service on our part vastly increases the love God has
for our persons; “For God loveth a cheerful giver”
(2 <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>, 7).</p>

<p class='c007'>And thus by the practice of Divine love the bond
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>that unites the human soul with our Blessed Lord
grows stronger and stronger. Therefore, while the
worldling sees nothing but hardships in the religious
state, the inmates of the cloister would consider it the
saddest misfortune if they were compelled to leave
their happy homes and return to the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>This love of God is that sacred fire of which Christ
said: “I am come to cast fire on the earth, and what
will I but that it be kindled?” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>, 49). It
shone with a most refulgent light when, on the day of
Pentecost, the Holy Ghost appeared in the form of
fiery tongues and filled the minds and hearts of the
disciples. And see how the Divine love, then received,
transformed the Apostles into new men. Before, they
had been very dull of comprehension, some of them
asking the Saviour on the day of His ascension whether
He was then going to restore the Kingdom of Israel;
then they became at once the infallible teachers of the
world. Before, they had been cowardly men, locked
up in the upper room for fear of the Jews; then they
were suddenly changed into heroes, rejoicing, when
they had been publicly whipped, that they were allowed
to suffer for the name of Jesus. All of them were glad
to die for their Lord. Countless martyrs were enkindled
with the same fire of love; men, timid women,
little boys, tender maidens, astonishing the Pagans by
their heroic fortitude.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the early persecutions were past, thousands
of solitaries retired from the allurements of the world,
and were led by the spirit of Divine love into frightful
solitudes to spend their lives in penance and prayer,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>thinking of God alone. Every subsequent age in the
history of the Church is replete with similar exhibitions
of the love of Jesus. Hundreds of thousands of Christians
left home and country, and sacrificed their lives
to rescue from the hands of Pagans the tomb of the
Redeemer. Others, during the Ages of Faith, devoted
their riches or their personal labor to erect magnificent
cathedrals, and provide a rich supply of gold
and silver vases, of precious vestments and ornaments
for the house of their beloved Lord.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the charity of many had grown cold, the
Blessed Saviour knew how to rekindle its fires by means
of the devotion to His Sacred Heart. He appeared to
His humble servant Blessed Margaret Mary Alacoque,
and said to her: “Behold the heart that has loved
men so much, and yet I receive nothing but ingratitude
in return.” The whole purpose of this beautiful devotion
is to elicit the love of human hearts for their
loving Saviour, so as to unite God and men together
by the golden bond of love.</p>

<p class='c007'>To promote this devotion Jesus has been liberal in
His promises. For those who practise it fervently He
promised that He would be their secure refuge during
life and above all in death, that He would bestow a
rich blessing on all their undertakings, that by it tepid
souls would become fervent, and fervent souls would
mount quickly to a high perfection, that He would
give to priests the gift of touching the hardest hearts,
that He would write in His sacred Heart the names of
those who would zealously promote this devotion and
He would never allow them to be blotted out.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>It is conformable to the sweet ways of Providence
to make the remedy of an evil reach further than the
disease. Thus, when our race had been disgraced by
the sin of Adam, God far more than repaired the
harm done; which makes holy Church exclaim with
gladness: “Oh, happy fault, which merited to have
such a Redeemer!” And so it has been with the devotion
to the Sacred Heart. It was instituted by the
Lord that men might learn to appreciate more highly
His love for us, and return Him a more ardent love
than was given Him before, to atone also for the coldness
and the sins of others, and to induce all to receive
more frequently His Sacred body and blood. It is
truly wonderful how successfully all this has been accomplished.
Now millions of persons of all ages and
conditions in life, have formed the excellent habit of
daily giving their first thoughts to elicit an act of love
for Jesus, and offering all their actions and sufferings
at the opening of each day for the intentions of the
Sacred Heart. And it is probably no exaggeration
to say that, since Christ’s desire of frequent Communions
was whispered by Him to Blessed Margaret Mary,
the number of Holy Communions daily received has
increased, not only a hundred but a thousand fold.</p>

<p class='c007'>And while such devout practices have thus multiplied
beyond all calculation, the main purpose of it all has
been attained to a most consoling extent. For while
the age in which we live is becoming more and more indifferent
and often hostile to the Lord, His true friends
long more ardently than before to return to Him love
for love, and to induce countless souls to serve Him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>in the spirit of love. This spirit no doubt animates
our own hearts. It has now been enkindled anew in
the Spiritual Exercises; and it ought to be the dominant
note in the new life for which this retreat has been
a preparation. Let us do our utmost, with the help of
Divine grace, to do all things henceforth in the spirit
of the love of God. This spirit of love is beautifully
expressed in the</p>

  <h3 id='day8-m3' class='c011'>THE THIRD MEDITATION <br> On Divine Love</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'>After our consideration on the value and excellence
of Divine love and its connection with the devotion
to the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we are now to meditate
on some striking manifestations of God’s love for us,
and on various ways in which we can manifest our
love for Him.</p>

<p class='c007'>We begin, with <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, by remarking that genuine
love does not consist in a mere feeling, or sentiment,
but in the will to please or benefit the person
loved, even at the cost of sacrifice on our part. For
instance, imagine two boys, coming home for vacation
from a boarding school, differing greatly in the manifestation
of their affection for parents and kindred,
whom both were glad to meet again. One of them
was very demonstrative of his tender feelings; you
would have thought that his love for all was far greater
than that of his less effusive brother. After a few
days however their father had a task for them to do
which required a little sacrifice on their part. Then
the affectionate lad had all manner of excuses to evade
the trouble, without giving a thought to his father’s
needs, while his brother quietly volunteered to do the
work of both. His love was genuine; such should be
our love for God.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second remark of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius is that love between
two persons is increased by the frequent interchange of
kindly services. The more we do for God, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>more we consider what He has done for us, the more
devoted we shall become to Him, and the more pleasing
in His sight.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you behold Jesus before you,
looking benignly down upon you as upon a loved child.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg fervently for an increase of love
for Him.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Recall to mind the principal benefits
you have received from God, from your birth till the
present day, both those common to you and all others,
and particularly those peculiar to yourself, tracing the
wonderful ways in which a benign Providence has
guided you to your present state. Render hearty
thanks to the Lord, and make Him the following offering
in return: “Accept, O Lord, all my liberty, accept
my memory, my understanding and my will. Thou
hast given me all these powers; I restore them all to
Thee, and I deliver them entirely into Thy hands that
Thou mayest direct them. Only give me Thy love and
Thy grace; these are all I desire.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> See how God is most intimately present
to you, not only as the water of the ocean is about
a sponge, before it and behind, above and below, right
and left of it and within every pore, but He penetrates
your entire body and soul, and His delight is to be with
the children of men.</p>

<p class='c007'>On your part resolve to keep yourself constantly in
the presence of God, cultivating the habit of thinking
lovingly about God, speaking with Him when not
otherwise employed. This need not cause a strain of
mind; it only gives an excellent direction to our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>thoughts and affections, which would otherwise be
wasted upon useless or perhaps even unworthy objects.
Lovingly offer this resolution to your dear Lord, and
ask Him to bless and prosper it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> Consider how God is unceasingly
working for you, as a loving father works for the support
of his children. He causes the earth to produce
whatever you need for food and raiment and lodging;
in far distant climes He makes the fruits and the spices
grow which are to refresh and to cheer you. Resolve,
in return, to labor strenuously for whatever will promote
the glory of God. The field of zealous labors for
the honor of God and the good of souls, the children
of God, is vast and varied. Christ bids us pray the
Lord of the harvest that he may send laborers into His
harvest (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 2). Offer yourself to be a devoted
laborer, ask for toils and even hardships in this
noble service. See what special efforts you can make
in this matter, and offer your resolves to the Lord.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>.</i> Every trait of goodness, whatever is
amiable or admirable in any creature, is but a faint
reflection of an infinite perfection in the Creator. A
bright flower, a vast prospect, a noble deed, an affectionate
heart and a thousand other charms found on
earth are able, each of them, to raise our minds to the
thought of the beauty, the grandeur, the infinite loveliness
of our dear Lord. Thus the sight of a pretty
flower sometimes threw <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius into an ecstasy of
Divine love.</p>

<p class='c007'>Resolve, that, whenever any charm on earth arouses
your love or admiration, you will take occasion from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>it to raise your heart to God, and to elicit an act of
love for Him who is the source and the pattern of all
that can duly delight the human heart.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Finish this last meditation of the retreat
with a generous consecration of yourself and of all
you have to the love and service of your dear Lord
and Master, either in your own words or in those of
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius quoted in the first point of this exercise,
or in the loving renovation of your religious vows.</p>

  <h2 id='trid-a' class='c010'>TRIDUUM <abbr class='spell'>A</abbr></h2>
</div>
<h3 id='trid-a-1' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='one'>I</abbr> <br> On the Desire of Perfection</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Hear Christ, in the Sermon on the
Mount, saying to His disciples: “Be ye perfect as
also your heavenly Father is perfect” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>,
48).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg for an earnest desire of perfection.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>One great hindrance to attain perfection</i>
is the want of desire to attain it, a want of proper
appreciation of this exalted privilege. This state of
mind is:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>Very unreasonable, unwise.</i> It is like the deplorable
disposition of many college boys, whom we
blame and despise, because they have not sense enough
to value their opportunity to acquire an education.
Their fault is palliated by their youth; they will be
sorry afterwards. There is no such excuse for religious.
They ought to know better. Striving after
perfection is the main duty of their state.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Very inexpedient for their happiness even in
this world.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>“The heart of man is made for God! nothing but
God can make it happy,” says <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Augustine. A lax
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>religious is less happy than a fervent one; he does not
enjoy that peace of mind which the world cannot
give; he worries, frets at many things, unlike the fervent.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>Inexpedient for the next life</i>, causing immense
loss of merit and future glory, exchanged for trifles.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <i>Injurious to our neighbor</i>, whose salvation depends
to a great extent on our holiness.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. A second hindrance to the attainment
of perfection</i> consists in a want of confidence of
attaining it. Some imagine that perfection, desirable
as it is in itself, is out of the question for them, they
are unworthy of aspiring to it. Now distrust of self
is excellent, but we must not distrust God, either His
power or His love for us. God is not like the man
condemned in the Gospel who began to build and could
not carry the building to completion. He has invited
us to aim at perfection; for that is the nature of the
religious life. We have accepted His invitation; it is
now for Him to furnish us copious means to attain
perfection. The die is cast; we are pledged to strive
after perfection, and God has pledged Himself to provide.
Father Lallemant, so enlightened in spiritual
matters, has left written that the holiness to which every
Jesuit is called surpasses all imagination, and that, if
any one could see the amount of grace that God has
prepared for each of us, he would conclude they were
destined for no less a Saint than an Ignatius or a
Xavier (Spiritual Doctrine, page 29).</p>

<p class='c007'>We ought confidently to say with <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul: “I can
do all things in him who strengtheneth me,” <span lang="la"><i>Omnia
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>possum in eo qui me confortat</i></span> (<abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 13), and with
the Psalmist: “If armies in camp should stand together
against me, my heart shall not fear,” <span lang="la">“<i>Si consistant
adversum me castra, non timebit cor meum</i>”</span>
(<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 26).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Some religious say they know not
how to attain perfection.</i> The way is plain enough, if
only we make up our mind to follow it. It requires:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>The faithful observance of our rules</i>: whoever
observes them perfectly is a real saint. We all observe
most of them; let us observe all of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Much good prayer</i>, performing our spiritual
exercises faithfully and fervently. In particular let
us perform this triduum to the best of our power.</p>

<p class='c007'>What is required for this purpose?</p>

<p class='c007'>a. Silence and recollection;</p>

<p class='c007'>b. Earnest meditations;</p>

<p class='c007'>c. Spiritual readings that speak to our hearts;</p>

<p class='c007'>d. Careful examinations of our spiritual progress.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with our dear Lord, asking for a thorough
renovation of Spirit.</p>
<h3 id='trid-a-2' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='two'>II</abbr> <br> In What Perfection Consists</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> See God enthroned in Heaven, and
all the Saints lovingly looking up to Him.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg grace to understand in what perfection
really consists.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> A thing is good if it answers fairly
well the purpose for which it is made; it is perfect if
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>it answers that purpose as well as is desirable. Thus
a pen is perfect if it is every way suitable to write
with, a watch is perfect if it always keeps time. Now
man is made to love God; he is therefore perfect if he
devotes himself entirely to the love of God. That
perfection consists formally in Charity is expressly
stated by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul, who writes to the Colossians:
“Above all things have charity, which is the bond of
perfection” (<abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 14).</p>

<p class='c007'>To attain perfection, therefore, we must accustom
ourselves to be totally taken up with God and God’s
interests, for God’s sake. This is the main purpose
aimed at by Father Faber in his excellent book “All
for Jesus.” Read for instance, pages 48, 49. Much
of this may be in many men merely sentimental, or
poetical. To make it actual in us, real in our conduct
and the dispositions of our will, seeking God in all
things, is true sanctity. At this we must steadily aim.
It is in fact the motto of our Society: <span lang="la"><i>Ad Majorem
Dei Gloriam</i></span>, “To the Greater Glory of God.” A
perfect man is a man of one idea, the idea of the
greater glory of God.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Such devotedness to God requires
detachment from all creatures</i>; this detachment is not
itself perfection, but it is a necessary condition to
attain this entire devotedness, in which perfection consists.
We must act like the man who had found a
treasure hidden in a field, who to secure it <i>went and
sold all he had</i> to buy that field; and like him who, to
buy the precious pearl, <i>went and sold all he had</i> (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>, 44-46). We must be detached. Our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>hearts are so narrow that we cannot give a part of
them to one object without detracting from our love
for another, except only if we love the former solely
for the sake of the latter. Thus we should love all
for God. Therefore we start on the road to perfection
by leaving all things to follow Him. It must not
prevent us from taking interest in many things, else
we become wooden saints. With a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Francis Xavier, a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Catherine of Sienna, etc., we
must cherish eager desires of many projects, but only
in as much as they promote God’s glory and the salvation
of souls.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. In particular the study of perfection
requires constant efforts</i>: 1. To adorn our soul with
more and more virtue, 2. To correct our faults, 3.
For this purpose, to labor earnestly at our particular
examen, our confessions, 4. To direct our spiritual
readings and meditations to the purposes of the illuminative
way, returning to the purgative way if there
arises some special need of it. Keep weeding, planting,
binding. The chief point in this triduum is to
see whether we have been of late seriously laboring
at the acquisition of perfection as we now understand
it: in particular whether we are attached to any creature
so as to retard our progress, or habituated to
commit any faults, which must be corrected; also how
we profit by our Holy Communions, our meditations,
etc., so as to promote steady progress in virtue.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Ask for the special graces of which you
see a present need.</p>

  <h3 id='trid-a-3' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='three'>III</abbr> <br> Christ the Model of Perfection</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> See Christ carrying His cross, and
saying: “<i>If any man will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross and follow me</i>” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 24).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for grace to follow Christ faithfully.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider the consoling truth that <i>Christ
has really made Himself our guide</i>. He is such
by word and example. We could not have a nobler nor
safer guide. He has led millions before us to the
highest happiness. In this text <i>He invites us to follow
Him</i>. Let us thank Him for this gracious offer and
eagerly accept it. He is to us what the Angel Raphael
was to Tobias. True, Tobias could see the Angel,
but he did not know who he was; we cannot see Christ,
but we know who He is and how He has acted. Our
Society undertakes to follow Him in all the details of
our lives. In this following consists perfection. We
are actually following Him; but how earnestly?
how generously? Can we not improve in many respects?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Consider the words: “<i>Let him deny
himself.</i>” Christ denied Himself: His ease, His
health and life, His honor. In trying to follow Him
we made a good beginning when we left our parents
and all earthly possessions; to crown the work we must
leave ourselves: <i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr>. Our ease</i>, by hard work, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>repining, with joy and perseverance. Many seculars
work much harder than we do, but many do so grudgingly.
Not so Christ; we must do like Him.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr>, Our health and life</i>, leaving all this in God’s
hands, with proper care indeed, but no solicitude. Oh,
if we could die in His service! It would be the greatest
happiness. We may have that good fortune if we
never shirk any duty. <i>3, Our honor.</i> Christ willingly
made Himself “A worm and no man, the reproach of
men and the outcast of the people” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 21). The
lowest on earth at first, He is now the highest in
Heaven, and He invites us to follow Him. When we
experience loss of ease, of health, of honor, how do
we take it?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> Consider the words: “<i>and take up
his cross</i>.” What is our cross? It is not so heavy as
Christ’s. Our cross is: <i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr>, Our daily tasks</i>. Perform
them faithfully, zealously, cheerfully. <i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr>, Our
afflictions, sufferings, failures, disappointments.</i> Be
patient, do not despond: “Sufficient for the day is the
evil thereof” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 34). Trust in God:
“No one hath hoped in the Lord and hath been confounded”
(<abbr title='Ecclesiasticus'>Ecclus.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 11).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr>, Our passions</i>; we must keep them in check by
unremitting efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>4th, The conduct of others</i>: “Blessed are ye when
they shall revile you—Be glad and rejoice for your
reward is very great in heaven” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 11).
“The sufferings of this time are not worthy to be compared
with the glory to come, that shall be revealed in
us” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii,</abbr> 18).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>.</i> Consider the words: “<i>And follow
me</i>.” Keep your eyes on Jesus carrying His cross.
Notice: 1. His exterior behavior. Do we properly
observe our rules of modesty? 2. His interior sentiments.
Like His Sacred Heart, is our heart at peace?
Kind to all? Conformable to God’s will? “Take up
my yoke upon you, and learn of me, because I am meek
and humble of heart, and you shall find rest to your
souls” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 29).</p>

<h3 id='trid-a-4' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr> <br> The Need of Prayer to Attain Perfection</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> See the Apostles around Christ, and
saying: “Lord teach us to pray” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 1).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg earnestly to become a man of
prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. No perfection is attainable without
much fervent prayer.</i> For perfection consists in charity,
the love of God, and this love is not natural to man.
Men naturally view everything as related to themselves,
to their earthly advantages of business, ease, pleasure,
honor, etc. Perfection substitutes God for self. This,
being altogether supernatural, requires much grace, and
the ordinary means to obtain grace is prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Those who enter on the way to perfection must be
trained to the pursuit of it. All religious Orders use
for this purpose a copious supply of prayer. Our
Society in particular has constant recourse to this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>means: the long retreats, the yearly octiduums, the triduums,
the daily meditations, holy masses, holy communions,
daily litanies, examinations of conscience, the
Divine Office, the beads, visits to the Blessed Sacraments,
etc. Most of these exercises are to be continued
during life.</p>

<p class='c007'>By all this prayer we get to realize practically what
worldlings know only in theory: God’s love, mercy,
majesty, holiness, justice, eternity, providence, etc.,
His incarnation, the Blessed Sacrament, the power and
love of Mary, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>When are we men of prayer?</i> When
we have learned to refer all things explicitly to God.
Cardinal Bellarmin points out three degrees of prayer:</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr>, Some speak to God, but hear no answer, like the
populace in the street crying to a distant king.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr>, Others receive some token that they are attended
to, like men admitted to an audience and allowed
to file a petition.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr title='third'>3rd</abbr>, Others converse with God and He with them;
they hear more than they say, and, like courtiers, can
approach their Lord frequently. How is it with us?
Are we accustomed to turn to God readily, confidently,
lovingly? Some have the gift of prayer before they
enter the novitiate, some get it during their early years
of religious life and ever increase it, some partly lose
it amid active duties, some get it at their ordination,
some during their third year of probation, while others
never acquire it to any great extent. It can be obtained
by earnest petition and fidelity in the practice of devout
prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>What difference does it make in a
man?</i> He may be a religious, but not a good one unless
he becomes a man of prayer; nor is he safe meanwhile.
For one cannot lead the life of a fervent and faithful
religious unless he possess considerable command over
his passions, and he cannot maintain this self-mastery
without much good prayer. Yet he may do so without
attaining the third degree of prayer. But when he
reaches that, he becomes a different man, a special
friend of God, enlightened, strengthened, not impeccable,
yet pretty safe; a powerful means for the salvation
of souls. Such have been all the models proposed
by holy Church for our imitation.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>.</i> <i>What chance have we Jesuits of becoming
men of prayer?</i> An excellent chance. The
third degree of prayer is a common gift of God in our
Society. It is the obvious tendency of our frequent
retreats. The Spiritual Exercises of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius aim
directly to produce this fruit, and the Lord has entrusted
the direction of them to our Fathers, whose
duty it is to give them to priests and the laity, even to
members of the most contemplative Orders. Many of
our ascetic writers exhibit this gift in a conspicuous
degree. Am I a man of prayer? What can I do to
improve in this important matter?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Earnest petition for the gift of prayer,
and for light and grace to take the proper measures
to procure progress.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you are listening to Christ at
the Sermon on the Mount while He says: “Ask and
it shall be given you, seek and you shall find, knock and
it shall be opened to you” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 7).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask earnestly to obtain great confidence
in prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>Prayer is a spiritual gold mine.</i> When
gold is discovered on a piece of arid land, the
owners have at once at their disposal the means of
becoming very rich. Similarly the soul that begins to
understand the efficacy of prayer can obtain by its
means a copious supply of actual graces, by which
Heaven and perfection are easily secured. For Providence
has so disposed that grace is readily obtained by
prayer, and some holy Doctors therefore call it the key
to the treasury of God. The riches of that treasury
are inexhaustible. They are intended for us and put
at our disposal. It was by prayer that a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Aloysius,
a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Stanislaus and countless others became saints in
their childhood, that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis Xavier,
etc., etc., were led from a worldly to a holy life. All
of us have the same means at our disposal.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>Listen to Christ’s own invitation and
promises.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Read <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 7-11, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 23, 24.</p>

<p class='c007'>Notice that these promises do not suppose great virtue
in him who prays. For Christ addresses them to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>sinners, saying: “If you being evil know how to give
good gifts to your children, how much more will your
Father who is in heaven give good things to them that
ask him?” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 11). We are most readily
heard when we ask for spiritual favors. This is
clearly stated by the Saviour, for He says: “How
much more will your Father from heaven give <i>the good
Spirit to them</i> that ask him?” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 13).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> Why are we not always heard in
prayer? Because we do not fulfil the required conditions.
1. We must ask what is really good for us.
For <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James writes: “You ask and receive not; because
you ask amiss, that you may consume it on your
concupiscences” (<abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 3).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. We must ask with great confidence. We go to
draw the waters of grace from a rich fountain, but the
vessel of our confidence may be so small that we can
carry off but little. While the multitudes pressed upon
Jesus on all sides, one afflicted woman was cured because
she touched Him with great confidence; and He
said: “Somebody hath touched me, for I know that
virtue is gone out from me.... But He said to her:
Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke
<abbr title='eight'>viii</abbr>, 46-48).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. We must ask with proper reverence and attention.</p>

<p class='c007'>For how could we expect God to mind our petitions
if we do not attend to them ourselves? If we pray
thus He may say: “This people honoreth me with
their lips, but their heart is far from me” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr>
<abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 8).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>4. We must pray with perseverance, as Christ
teaches by the parable of the importunate man who
came to ask for aid during the night, and obtained it
because he persevered in his importunity (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>,
5-8).</p>

<p class='c007'>5. We must pray with resignation to God’s will, as
Christ Himself did in His agony, saying: “My
Father, if it be possible, let this chalice pass from me.
Nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr>
<abbr title='twenty-six'>xxvi</abbr>, 39). We must be full of confidence that no good
prayer ever goes up to Heaven which does not obtain
a grace; but God knows best what grace will benefit us
most, and He deals with us as a loving father with his
children.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Ask eagerly for great confidence in the
power of prayer.</p>
<h3 id='trid-a-6' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='six'>VI</abbr> <br> The Aid of Mary to Attain Perfection</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> See the Blessed Virgin Mary in

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for a fervent devotion to her.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider what part God has assigned
to her, in the salvation and sanctification of mankind.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The first promise of the Redeemer referred to her as
destined to crush the serpent’s head. The work of the
redemption began with her at the Annunciation. At
her voice Elizabeth and her child were filled with the
Holy Ghost. As through Mary Jesus was given to the
world, so through her He is given to His servants individually.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>As she was with Jesus all through His life
on earth, so Mary is ever ready to aid each one of us
all through our earthly pilgrimage. On Calvary all
of us were committed to her care in the person of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
John. In her company the disciples received the Holy
Ghost. She has been bodily taken up to Heaven to
intercede for us with the Lord, and to beckon us on to
follow her. She is daily co-operating for the sanctification
of numberless souls through her multifarious religious
Orders and Congregations, her Rosary and
Scapular Societies and divers other Confraternities,
etc., <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Liguori and various other Doctors say that
every grace given to men passes through her hands and
that a true child of Mary is never lost.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>Consider what the Blessed Virgin
Mary has been to our Society in particular.</i> She appeared
to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius at Loyola, set the seal on his
conversion and freed him once for all from temptations
of the flesh; she made him her devoted Knight at
Mont-Serrat; she aided him in composing his Spiritual
Exercises at Manresa; she received the first vows of the
little band at Montmartre on the feast of her Assumption.
She figures most conspicuously in the lives of
all our Saints; of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Stanislaus, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Aloysius, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John
Berchmans, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Alphonsus, Blessed Baldinucci, etc.,
etc. She has given us the direction of her Sodalities,
and by its means has helped us to promote piety and
purity among countless numbers of her clients. Thank
her warmly for all she has done in our favor, and ask
an increase of sanctity for yourself and for all your
religious brethren.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>Let each one consider what favors
he personally owes to the Blessed Virgin.</i> Retrace in
mind your practices of devotion to her from your early
childhood to the present day. Offer once more all you
have ever done in her honor. Think of the protection
she has afforded you with a mother’s love, her probable
influence on your vocation to the Society, on your
novice fervor, on all your religious life up to the present
day. Is there any devotion which you ever practised
in her honor and which you have since discontinued?

<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine the scene of your first vows.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask light and grace to prepare for a
fervent renovation.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> What did we do when we first took
our vows?</p>

<p class='c007'>We offered ourselves to God as a holocaust—with
parents, home, possessions, prospects—body and soul—understanding
and will,—to belong to God alone, to
devote our entire life to His service and glory. If we
had died then, what would have been our reward?
Life everlasting (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix</abbr>, 29). That reward
is still due us; it cannot be forfeited or even diminished
except by mortal sin. And if thus lost, it is regained
by penance in its entirety. Thank the Lord warmly for
such a treasure, ask grace to be ever faithful, and to
profit by this triduum to increase your fervor.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>What has been our life ever since?</i>
The gradual consummation of the great sacrifice, the
accomplishment of our spiritual martyrdom. Then we
entered the prison, the exile; now we are leading the
martyr’s life, dying the martyr’s death. If we do not
find it hard, it is because grace supports us: <span lang="la">“<i>Facile
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>equitat quem gratia Dei portat</i>”</span>, “He rides along with
ease who is borne up by the grace of God,” says Thomas à
Kempis. Still our life may be at times unsatisfactory;
it is a martyr’s life, above the power of mere
human nature, full of merit, doing honor to God, hated
by the enemies of God, salutary to ourselves and to the
neighbor. This life is never at a standstill, but ever
moving onward and upward; therefore it is up-hill
work. And because it is a combat against sensual inclinations,
it has its alterations of successes and reverses;
its progress heavenward is not represented by a
straight but by a curved line. When it gets below a
certain level, or tends downwards at all, we must beware.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la"><i>Facilis descensus Averni</i></span>, “The descent to Hell is

  <h3 id='trid-b-2' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='two'>II</abbr> <br> On Renovation of the Vows</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine God says to you: “My son,
give me thy heart” (<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-three'>xxiii</abbr>, 26).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask grace to do so most earnestly.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>Consider the origin of this renovation.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>It was begun by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius and his first companions
while they were students at Paris, where they met every
year in the Church of Montmartre, on the feast of the
Assumption of the Blessed Virgin, the anniversary of
their first vows, to quit all things and live for God
alone. The practice was afterwards incorporated in
the Constitution of our Society, and has been adopted
by numerous religious Congregations. It has been
found so productive of good results that it ought to encourage
all to perform the same most fervently.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>What are the purposes of this renovation?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. It confirms and reasserts the total dedication of
ourselves to the service of God; as Holy Church invites
her children, when they have attained the age of discretion,
to renew by their own act the promises made in
their name by their sponsors at Baptism. If any hindrance
interfered with the validity of our first vows, the
obstacle being now removed, the renovation of the
vows gives them permanent force.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. It may often be more meritorious than the first
vows had been, since it is made after the hardships of
the religious life have been experienced and are therefore
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>more fully realized than before. As the soldier
who reenlists in an army shows more devotedness to
its cause than he did by first joining the ranks of the
army.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Since the vows act as a second Baptism, removing
all sin and all punishment due to sin, and this
precious effect is ascribed by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Thomas Aquinas to
the perfect charity which the vows imply, the same results
may naturally be expected whenever the vows are
renewed with the same good will. And this same good
will is most apt to be present at the semi-annual renovation
of the vows.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. As the religious vows entitle the soul to a rich
supply of actual graces that it may be faithful to their
observance, so the earnest renovation of the same secures
a new supply of such Divine aid to advance steadily
in the pursuit of sanctity.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Every act of virtue increases the measure of our
eternal happiness, especially acts of heroic virtue; the
loving renovation of the vows is sure to add each time a
rich jewel to our heavenly crown. Taking the religious
vows generously has always a touch of the heroic about
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Each renovation of the vows strengthens our
resolves, and clamps us more firmly to God. It often
takes many a blow to drive in a nail and make it stick
with firmness, so with our virtuous resolutions.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>What are we expected to do during
this triduum?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>We must aim at a thorough renovation of the religious
spirit; and for this purpose generous souls will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>devise various means. But to a certain extent our
Society undertakes to direct our efforts by describing
certain definite practices, which must be faithfully used
by all. They are clearly marked out in the Letter of
Father Vincent Caraffa: 1. Avoiding all unnecessary
intercourse with the outside world; 2. Observing a
strict silence, even during the times of the ordinary
recreations; 3. Half an hour’s reading daily of a practical
spiritual book. 4. Making two earnest meditations
daily, one of them before the Blessed Sacrament
exposed; 5. Examining one’s spiritual progress for
half an hour every day; 6. A general confession of the
last six months; 7. A public self-accusation of faults
in the refectory; 8. A clear account of conscience to
the superior. If all this is observed and performed in
the right spirit, much profit will result.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Offer good resolutions, and ask further
light and grace to correct all faults.</p>
<h3 id='trid-b-3' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='three'>III</abbr> <br> What Kind of Men Does Our Vocation Require?</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine Christ says to you: “I have
given you an example” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>, 15).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Pray to understand this great truth
and to imitate that glorious model.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>Consider that the men required by
our vocation are to be like to Christ</i>: “Whom God
foreknew he also predestinated to be made conformable
to the image of his Son” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii,</abbr> 29). A parable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>will explain this. A very rich man had an only son, a
model of every virtue and adorned with every human
accomplishment. He devoted a large portion of his
fortune to educate a number of other boys that should
be fit companions for that son as like to him as possible.
Thus God is treating all His elect, and in particular the
members of the Society of Jesus. That is the very
purpose for which <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius was inspired to found
our Society and to give us his Constitution. We are
destined to be perfect images of Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>Consider some special points of resemblance
that the Lord requires of us.</i> We must be:
1. <i>Like Christ in our outward behavior</i>, so that He
may appear reflected or reproduced in each one of us.
That is the purpose of our Rules of Modesty, to which
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius was taught by the Holy Ghost to attach
more than usual importance. Do we observe them
faithfully? If we do not, it is because we fail to
realize fully the ideal of our founder, which was nothing
less than the image of the Son of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>Like Christ in our inner sentiments</i>, in compliance
with His own invitation: There is so much
meaning in His words inviting us to this special manner
of imitation: “Learn of me because I am meek
and humble of heart” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 29). These two
virtues are so conspicuous in our Divine model.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Meekness</i> is emblemized by the gentlest of animals,
the tender lamb; and Christ was figured in the Old
Testament by the sacrifice of the lamb, and proclaimed
in the New Testament by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John the Baptist with the
words: “Behold the Lamb of God” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 29).
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>This is not the characteristic virtue of a warrior, such
as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius had been; but he had laid aside that
garment of his youth and instead had put on Christ,
as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul teaches us to do, saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>, 14).
We must do the same. <i>Humility</i> is most conspicuous
throughout the life of Christ; it must be the foundation
of all our spiritual life: “He emptied himself, taking
the form of a servant” (<abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 7).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>Like Christ in our practical reason</i>, taking God’s
view of all things, in opposition to the views of the
world. The whole outlook on life of a good religious
is very different from the outlook of the worldling.
Therefore the world hates us: “If you had been of
the world, the world would love its own; but because
you are not of the world, but I have chosen you out of
the world, therefore the world hateth you” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John
<abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 19). How can we acquire this unworldly spirit,
which is the spirit of Christ? By meditation, spiritual
reading, all manner of prayer, recollection, spiritual
conversation, etc. Are we making earnest efforts on
these lines? Do we avoid profane reading as far as
our labors allow? Novels and newspapers are full of
the spirit of the world, and so is unnecessary conversation
with most seculars.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <i>Like Christ in our wills</i>, which should be ever
intent on promoting the glory of God and ever zealous
to procure the salvation of souls. Our zeal should
cause us to labor hard, wherever an opportunity can be
found to further the great purpose of our Society, the
greater glory of God.</p>

<h3 id='trid-b-4' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr> <br> Christ Is Here to Help Us</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Realize the fact that Christ is present
on the altar, and hear Him say: “Behold, I am with
you all days” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-eight'>xxviii</abbr>, 20).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for a lively faith in Christ’s presence
in our midst, and a firm confidence in His loving
assistance.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <i>In what sense is Christ present on the
altar?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr>. <i>Substantially</i>, personally, body and soul, God
and Man. Make a firm act of faith, adore Him, lovingly
thank Him.</p>

<p class='c007'><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr>. <i>As our helper</i>: “Come to me, all ye that
labor and are burthened, and I will refresh you” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 28). He will help us in attaining the purpose
for which He has brought us to the Society, to
perfect our souls and to save others; in particular to
bless the work of this renovation of spirit. In Him
we can do all things: “I can do all things in him who
strengtheneth me” (<abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 13). Ask eagerly for a
thorough renovation. Examine whether your visits
are fervent enough.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>What treasure do we possess in the
holy Mass?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>No one but God could have conceived the blessing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>granted to the faithful of being present in their successive
generations at the mystical renovation of the
sacrifice of the cross. There, before us, day after day,
the same Redeemer of the world who made Himself
the victim of expiation of our sins on Calvary, makes
Himself a victim again in the same sacrifice, and offers
Himself to His eternal Father, as truly as He did then,
to obtain for those present in particular the graces they
desire from His liberality. No prayer could be more
powerful than the holy Mass. If only we duly enter
into the spirit of it, a spirit of deep reverence, of eager
supplication, of lively confidence, the daily Mass cannot
fail to be for us a copious source of the choicest
blessings. Whenever we find ourselves in some special
need of God’s assistance, let us offer or hear Mass for
that purpose. The result will not always be visible,
but it will probably often be so, and it will always be
very real.</p>

<p class='c007'>How do we profit daily by this wondrous grace? It
will be an important gain towards the renewing of
spirit if we improve our manner of attendance at holy
Mass.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>What do we receive in Holy Communion?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>We receive God Himself, no greater gift is possible.
And we receive Him as our food; that is, coming to do
for our soul what food does for the body, giving it
strength and growth, and keeping it from corruption.
Each worthy Communion increases in us sanctifying
grace, gives us an additional supply of actual grace to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>lead holy lives, and, as the Council of Trent declares,
it frees us from venial sins and preserves us from falling
into mortal sins.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the amount of grace received in Holy Communion
depends in great part on our own dispositions.
We can greatly increase it by making careful preparation
for the reception of our Lord, by fervor at the
moment of reception, reciting firm acts of faith in
the Divine presence, humble acts of adoration, acts of
ardent love and of eager desire and petitions for Divine
graces. The time of thanksgiving after Holy Communion
contains some of the most precious moments
of the day. How do I profit by this golden opportunity
to enrich my poor soul? Can I improve my ways
in this respect? We read in the Life of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Alphonsus
Rodriguez written by a lay brother (<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr> 81, 82), that
on All Saints’ Day, 1612, after he had received Holy
Communion amid the Scholastics and Brothers of the
community, Christ “showed him in a sensible manner
His presence in the hearts of all those who had just
received Him, so that he perceived the Saviour resplendent
with glory whole and entire in each religious.”
Thus Christ is really present in each of us during those
precious moments. Can we not give Him a more loving
and honorable reception than we often do?</p>

  <h3 id='trid-b-5' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='five'>V</abbr> <br> The Holy Ghost Sanctifies Us</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Listen to the words of Christ: “I will
ask the Father and he shall give you another Paraclete”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv</abbr>, 16).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> “Come, O Holy Ghost, replenish the
hearts of Thy faithful.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> It is a great consolation to us to remember
that we are not expected to work out our
perfection by our own power.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>The Holy Ghost is to be the principal agent in this
work of sanctification</i>; for <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul wrote: “The
charity of God (and this is sanctity) is poured forth in
our hearts by the Holy Ghost, who is given to us”
(<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 5). See what He did in the Apostles, in the
early Christians generally, what he has done in all the
Saints, in the faithful throughout the ages, and in particular
in religious, whom He has selected and separated
from the world to make them masterpieces of holiness.
Conceive eager desires of His gifts and a firm confidence
in His assistance. Beg earnestly for His light
and grace to advance in virtue.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <i>How does the Holy Ghost sanctify
us?</i> Not in a miraculous way, in which He sanctified
the Apostles, but by a gradual process: 1. By the Sacraments,
Baptism, Confirmation, Holy Eucharist, Penance
He has been working in our souls from our early
infancy. Make earnest acts of thanksgiving, for these
Divine graces already received. 2. By our spiritual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>exercises, our meditations, attendance at Mass, examinations
of conscience, visits to the Blessed Sacrament,
spiritual readings, vocal prayers of various kinds; during
which the Spirit of God enlightens us, suggests holy
resolutions, encourages and strengthens us to make
generous sacrifices.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus we have gradually been formed, to some extent,
into spiritual men. If we are not yet more spiritual,
it is because we did not sufficiently comply with the
inspirations of the Holy Ghost, but resisted His efforts
to sanctify us further, like those to whom <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Stephen
said: “You always resist the Holy Ghost: as your
fathers did, so you do also” (Acts <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 51). 3. The
Spirit of God sanctifies us by assisting all our efforts to
advance in virtue, aiding us to believe, to hope, to love
God, to practise charity to the neighbor, humility, prudence,
mortification, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <i>All this influence of the Holy Ghost
requires our cooperation.</i> The best teacher cannot
make a scholar of a careless boy. Cardinal Manning
in his Internal Mission of the Holy Ghost has a passage
explaining this point very forcibly. He says:
“No grace that God gives ever fails of its effect, except
through our fault. The seed that falls upon the barren
sand can bear no fruit; that which is cast upon the
sea cannot cast a root; that which falls upon a mind
which is like the troubled sea, or upon a heart which
is like the barren sand, will bear no spiritual fruit.
Nevertheless the grace of God in itself is always fruitful;
it never fails of its effect unless we mar it. Are
you then corresponding with the exuberant graces
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>which God is always bestowing upon you?... Learn
then to have a delicate conscience, to understand
promptly, and to correspond, if you can, proportionately;
not to receive great graces languidly, and squander
one-half of them, and correspond faintly with the
rest. Try with your whole soul and strength to rise
up and to obey, when the grace of God calls you to any
higher state or to any better action” (Pages 32 and
33). Yet, whatever our natural disposition may be,
by the aid of the Holy Ghost we may become diligent
and fervent in the pursuit of every virtue; for, as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Paul says: “The Spirit also helpeth our infirmity.
For we know not what we should pray for as we ought;
but the Spirit himself asketh for us with unspeakable
groanings” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii,</abbr> 26). Let us carefully consider
what we must improve on this occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with the Holy Ghost, the Sanctifier, begging

<h3 id='trid-b-6' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='six'>VI</abbr> <br> Effects Produced by the Holy Ghost</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you behold the scene of the
descent of the Holy Ghost on the Apostles, as narrated
in Acts <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 1-4.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for a liberal infusion of the
Gifts of the Holy Ghost. We will consider the principal
effects produced by the Holy Ghost in the soul
as they are expressed in four verses of the <i>Veni Creator</i>.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> <span lang="la"><i>Accende lumen sensibus</i></span>, “Enlighten
our minds.” See what a change the Holy Ghost
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>produced in the minds of the Apostles. They had
failed to understand the teaching of the Blessed
Saviour. He had said to them: “Behold we go up to
Jerusalem, and all things shall be accomplished which
were written by the prophets concerning the Son of
man. For he shall be delivered to the Gentiles, and
shall be mocked, and scourged and spit upon. And
after they have scourged him, they will put him to
death, and the third day he shall rise again.” And <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Luke adds: “And they understood none of those
things, and this word was hid from them, and they understood
not the things that were said” (<abbr title='eighteen'>xviii</abbr>, 31-34).
And a little while before Christ’s ascension into Heaven
the Apostles asked Him: “Lord, wilt thou at this time
restore again the Kingdom to Israel?” (Acts <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 6).
They were still so blinded that they only looked for
earthly power. But the Holy Ghost came down upon
them, and at once they understood all the meaning of
Christ’s doctrine.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ever since that day the same Divine Spirit has been
teaching the Church, enlightening the minds of its members,
enabling them, not only to give a mental assent
to the doctrines proposed, but habitually to take God’s
view of things. This is done by the faithful generally,
even very simple souls, “Thou hast revealed them to
little ones” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 21). This should be done by
us, religious, especially, and it should characterize our
teaching and the tone of our conversations; while on
the other hand, “The sensual man perceiveth not these
things that are of the Spirit of God; for it is foolishness
to him and he cannot understand” (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 14).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> <span lang="la"><i>Infunde amorem cordibus</i></span>, “Infuse
Thy love into our hearts.” The Love of God is sanctity,
and it is a gift of the Spirit of God. “The charity
of God is poured forth in our hearts by the Holy Ghost
who is given to us” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 5). It is the most
precious of all gifts and, like every good gift, it is to be
obtained by fervent and constant prayer. For “Every
best gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming
down from the Father of lights” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 17).
We are especially encouraged to ask this gift from God,
by the fact that Christ Himself assures us that the Lord
loves to bestow this treasure on those who eagerly ask
for it; for he says:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How much more will your Father from heaven give
the Good Spirit to them that ask him?” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>,
13). Pray for it fervently, on this occasion in particular.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> <span lang="la"><i>Infirma nostri corporis virtute firmans
perpeti</i></span>, “Strengthen the weakness of our bodies with
lasting power.” Give us the virtue of fortitude, an
abiding willingness to do and to suffer whatever the
service of God may require. This willingness is
the test of our love for Him and the chief means of our
sanctification. We exercise this willingness by patiently
toiling along, suffering checks and contradictions,
meeting with disappointments without being disheartened
by them, enduring fatigue, pain, regret, shame,
etc. We may meet all these trials in the sacred ministry,
in the classroom, in humble labor, anywhere; and
that not occasionally, but daily, hourly, yet without
fretting or murmuring, but cheerfully, joyously, buoyantly,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>scarcely noticing them, but treating them as matters
of course in a life of generous sacrifice. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Augustine points out three degrees of patience. In the
lowest degree are those who would rather endure their
sufferings than commit sin to escape from them.
Those are in the second degree who accept willingly
what God sends, simply because God wills it. We ascend
to the third degree when we desire to suffer that
we may more closely resemble our suffering Lord.
This is a special gift of the Holy Ghost, our third degree
of humility.</p>

</div>
<h3 id='trid-c-1' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='one'>I</abbr> <br> On the Need of Frequent Renovations of Spirit</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul writes to the Ephesians:
“Be renewed in the spirit of your mind” (<abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 23).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask grace to increase greatly your
spirit of fervor.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> It is one of the infirmities of our
fallen nature that we are constantly drawn down to
sensual and other selfish gratifications; and, to rise
heavenward in our desires, we need the exertion of
ever renewed efforts. As truly as the clock needs repeated
winding up, so the soul needs frequent remindings
of the vital truths which cause our lives to be
supernatural. For this purpose, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius has
wisely provided these semi-annual renovations of
spirit. If we did not care to renew our spirit of fervor
at the proper time, the Lord might do it for us by
means far more painful than we imagine. Bitter afflictions
brought on individual persons or upon entire
bodies of men, even such as are favorites of God, are
often intended by Him to purify them from moral
stains. Thus, some years before the suppression of
our Society, Father Paradiso was instructed by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>Lord to inform Father Ricci, then our Father General,
that the calamities which were going to overwhelm us
were intended to renew the spirit of humility, of faith
and piety in the whole Church. (See <abbr class='spell'>B. N.</abbr>’s “The
Jesuits and Their History,” <abbr title='volume'>Vol.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>, Page 179.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> Another reason for this semi-annual
renovation of the spirit of fervor is that our life calls
for men of uncommon virtue. The whole history of
our Order proves this truth. Every generation of our
members has had numerous heroes, conspicuous for
their spirit of self-sacrifice. Every generation has
had much need of solid virtue on the part of all its
members to perform the difficult tasks imposed on
them. For the present we are passing through a crisis
in the world’s history, which calls for the most patient
endurance of ills, and the most generous spirit of sacrifice,
that can be expected from brave and faithful
men supported by the grace of God. Such virtue as
you shall need during your lifetime, if you do not
want to disgrace the name you bear, can only be acquired
by leading a life of prayer, and by the ever
faithful performance of your duties, no matter what
sacrifices they may require.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> The purpose for which we have entered
on this career is well worthy of all the sacrifices
it may demand of us. No grander purpose can be
conceived. God Himself never holds out a higher
aim than that which we are vowed to labor for, namely
most perfect happiness for ourselves and for a countless
multitude of other souls. In fact, the aim of our
lives is identical with that for which the Son of God
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>came down from Heaven, and toiled and suffered upon
earth, namely the procuring of the greater glory of
God; <span lang="la"><i>Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>We could not have entered upon this grand career
if the Lord had not given us extraordinary graces to
do so. He has deigned to make the sacrifices implied
in it comparatively easy and full of consolations; and
if only we keep up our trust in Him, He will make the
rest of our lives flow on in the same even current of
loving worship. They will not be lives of ease and
earthly comforts; far from it. They will be successions
of sacrifices, as was the life of Christ. But he
rides smoothly along whom the grace of God carries
onward, <span lang="la"><i>facile equitat quem gratia Dei portat</i></span>; and
we shall be cheered on at every step by the prospect of
eternal bliss: “They that sow in tears shall reap in
joy. Going they went and wept, casting their seeds;
but coming they shall come with joyfulness, carrying
their sheaves” (<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 125).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Ask earnestly for a thorough renovation
of the spirit of generous service, which is to be the
fruit of this triduum.</p>
<h3 id='trid-c-2' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='two'>II</abbr> <br> Sin the Chief Hindrance to Our Progress</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine Christ speaks to you from
the tabernacle and says: “You are my friends if you
do the things that I command you” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 14).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for copious light and grace to
observe God’s commandments perfectly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider how much we ought to hate
even the smallest sin.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>In our first meditation we considered the grand purpose
for which we live, the attainment of eternal bliss
for ourselves and others and the greater glory of God.
Now sin is the greatest obstacle in our way; it bars
our road to Heaven and directly insults our Lord.
The condition of Christ’s friendship is the observance
of His commandments: “You are my friends if you
do the things that I command you.” To sin is to
break those commandments. If it does not always
turn us against God, it at least displeases Him. Even
a venial sin is a greater evil than any temporal loss.
We should rather die than wilfully commit one.</p>

<p class='c007'>This disposition is the second degree of humility,
on which we resolve to live in every good retreat. To
it Christ lovingly invites us, saying: “He that hath
my commandments and keepeth them, he it is that loveth
me; and he that loveth me shall be loved by my
Father; and I will love him, and will manifest myself
to him.... If any one love me, he will keep my
word, and my Father will love him, and we will come
to him and make our abode with him. He that loveth
me not keepeth not my word” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='fourteen'>xiv</abbr>, 21-24).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Consider the principal causes of
sins.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. One general cause is our thoughtlessness; we are
unmindful of the great truths of religion, the supernatural
light of which is allowed to grow dim amid the
distractions of a busy or a frivolous life. Ecclesiasticus
warns us, saying: “In all thy works remember
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>thy last end, and thou shalt never sin” (<abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 40). Now
the remedy of this thoughtlessness is provided for us
in our spiritual exercises: our meditations, examinations
of conscience, spiritual readings, etc. The religious
who is accustomed to perform these faithfully
and fervently is not likely to commit many sins, and he
will gradually become more and more virtuous.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Another copious source of sins consists of unmortified
passions. When any passion is aroused, it
blinds us to the dictates of reason and the whisperings
of grace. You see this in the conduct of an angry
man: he says and does things which he is afterwards
ashamed of and sorry for. It is so with all unrestrained
passions. Consider what are your most frequent
faults and what are their causes. What passions
need particularly to be watched and checked.
The triduum is just the time for self-introspection,
examinations of conscience, and for the ordering of
our spiritual exercises.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Consider some faults in particular</i>,
against which a religious should be guarded.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Violation of fraternal charity, whether in word
or thought; ever remember the words of Christ:
“Amen, I say to you, as long as you did it to one of
these my least brethren, you did it to me” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr>
<abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv</abbr>, 40).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Irreverence in prayer: disrespectful posture, wilful
or careless wandering of the mind, want of proper
preparation, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Sensuality in food and drink, or in the indulgence
of superfluous sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>4. Immodesty of touch or look, effeminate softness
of manner or language, imprudent familiarity.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Human respect, more anxiety to please men than
to please the Lord, and therefore doing or saying what
is unlawful or imprudent, or omitting to do what conscience
dictates to be our duty.</p>

things?</i> It means such fidelity in doing God’s will on
all occasions as to neglect no details, even the least
important. What is there in those details that makes
them precious? It is their conformity to the will of
God. That is what Christ valued in them. The
greatest things on earth are insignificant trifles in the
sight of God; but the least act of conformity to God’s
will has a Divine worth, and therefore is more precious
than any merely natural performance. Faith
teaches us to appreciate this truth; Christ came to enforce
it by the example of His private life. How do I
act in this matter? Am I habitually faithful in observing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>all my rules, even those which seem to be of
less importance?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Consider the importance of such fidelity.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. This fidelity is a necessary precaution against the
commission of great faults. For Ecclesiasticus tells
us: “He that contemneth small things shall fall by
little and little” (<abbr title='nineteen'>xix</abbr>, 1). And our Blessed Saviour
teaches: “He that is faithful in that which is least is
faithful also in that which is greater; and he that is
unjust in that which is little is unjust also in that which
is greater” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 10). Thus small faults in
the matter of charity, poverty, sensuality, chastity, etc.,
gradually lead to grievous sins. No one becomes at
once a great sinner or a great saint.</p>

<p class='c007'><span lang="la"><i>Nemo repente fit summus</i></span>, says the old proverb.
Before Judas sold our Lord for thirty pieces of silver,
he had accustomed himself to lesser acts of injustice,
as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John tells us, saying of him that “he was a thief,
and having the purse, carried the things that were put
therein” (<abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>, 6).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Our lives are mostly made up of minor acts, as
were the private lives of Jesus, Mary and Joseph, and
countless Saints. A Martyr’s crown in Heaven may
consist of one brilliant gem, the ruby of his heroic
death; but the crowns of most Saints are made up of
countless sparkling little diamonds, each the reward
of fidelity in a little thing. Thus too in human things,
in which perfection depends on minor details. For
instance, the politeness of the man who is to the manner
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>born is not displayed in extraordinary actions, but in
that delicate tact which makes him know his place, so
that he never acts amiss, and always says the right
word and does the right thing at the right time. This
fidelity is, in spiritual things, what good taste is in
literature and the other fine arts. Masterpieces differ
from common works in the perfection of the least details;
for instance, in sculpture, painting, etc., etc.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>.</i> It is by fidelity in minor matters that
we acquire the solid virtues needed to perform heroic
deeds when the occasion calls for them. This is
brought about in two ways.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>1. Naturally.</i> Our conduct on all occasions, even
the most important, depends to a great extent on the
good or evil habits we have acquired. Now habits
are acquired by the frequent repetition of acts. It is
only in little things that actions can be frequently repeated;
for few of us have numerous opportunities to
do great things. Therefore our habits, good or bad,
are ordinarily the result of our fidelity or infidelity in
little things.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>2. Supernaturally.</i> Acts of virtue practised by us
obtain for us additional actual graces to practise yet
more acts of virtue: and thus faithful souls constantly
strengthen the chain of graces which binds
them ever more closely to God. Unfaithful souls forfeit
these additional helps of grace that were in store
for them; and thus their chain of graces is gradually
weakened, so that temptations may occur which cause
them serious falls into sin. Examine your daily conduct
of fidelity to grace.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span><i>Colloquy</i>, according to the sentiments evoked by
these considerations.</p>
<h3 id='trid-c-4' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr> <br> The Observance of Our Rules</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you see <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, as he is
often painted, with the book of his Constitutions in
his hands.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg through his intercession for a
high appreciation of our rules.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. What are the rules of our Society?</i>
They are a summary of those wonderful Constitutions
which the Holy Ghost has used for the conversion and
sanctification of countless multitudes of souls during
the last four centuries, namely:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Of the numerous members of our Society during
the successive generations, so many of whom have
given evident proofs of having attained heroic sanctity.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Of vast numbers of other persons of the clergy
and the laity who have been saved and sanctified by
the virtues and the labors of the members of our Society.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Why are these rules so productive of
sanctity?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. Because they are not merely human work; for
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, in writing his Constitutions, obtained by
fervent prayer the special assistance of the Holy
Ghost. This is evident from the history of the Saint.
(For instance, Genelli’s “Life of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius,” <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 248).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>2. Because they lead the way to the perfect imitation
of Christ. By his Spiritual Exercises <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius
makes us conceive the most lofty ambition that
can be aroused within the human heart, namely to
make itself comformable to the heart of Jesus; and
by his rules he guides us through all the details of our
earthly career to the realization of this lofty purpose.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. How do our rules accomplish this
end?</i> By animating all our actions with the spirit of
the three highest virtues: of Faith, Hope and Charity.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. They aid us to lead <i>a life of faith</i>. For whenever
we observe a rule, we thereby elicit an act of
faith, accepting the letter of the rule or the word of
our superior as the expression of the Divine will.
Our life is thus made to consist of a succession of supernatural
acts.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. They make us live <i>a life of hope</i>. He that follows
his own judgment leans on a fragile reed; but he
that acts because the rules prescribe a certain course
thereby trusts God more than his own reasoning and
thus hopes in the help of God. He shall not be disappointed.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. They perfect in us <i>the love of God</i>. For they
constantly prescribe what tends to the greater glory of
God: <span lang="la"><i>Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam</i></span>.</p>

<p class='c007'>Do I observe all my rules faithfully? Does any of
them cause me a special difficulty? Perhaps I do not
understand it well; all of them, if rightly understood,
are most reasonable.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with our dear Lord, asking for great fidelity
to observe all our rules.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>
  <h3 id='trid-c-5' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='five'>V</abbr> <br> Zeal for Souls</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Hear Christ saying: “I am come to
cast fire on the earth; and what will I but that it be
kindled?” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>, 49).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask earnestly that this fire be enkindled
in your heart and that you may help to spread
it far and wide.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. That fire is Divine Charity.</i> It is
poured forth into the hearts of men by the Holy Spirit
who is given to us (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 5). It makes us lead a
supernatural life, the life of children of God, and in
this sense a Divine life. As the vegetable life transforms
the clod of earth into the fairest flower and the
most luscious fruit; as animal life turns the food into
the wonderful organism of the human body; so the
life of grace gives to our acts a heavenly value. By
it sinners become saints, true children of God. Christ
shows intense earnestness in spreading this fire, which
is really His greatest work: the most Divine of all
Divine works is the salvation of souls. The Angels
are ministering spirits to aid in this task. All human
efforts are children’s play in comparison with this.
To save a soul is a grander achievement than to conquer
an empire.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. This sublime work is done chiefly
through the agency of men.</i> Its great promoter was
the God-man Himself, the Son of God incarnate.
But He has deigned to associate to Himself the Apostles
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>and their successors, the bishops and priests of
His Church, till the end of time; to whom He has
said: “Going therefore teach ye all nations ... and
behold I am with you all days, even to the consummation
of the world” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-eight'>xxviii</abbr>, 19, 20).
With these the Lord has associated in a special manner,
through the mission of His Church, various apostolic
Orders of religious, our own Society in particular:
“I have chosen you and have appointed you that
you should go and should bring forth fruit, and that
your fruit should remain” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 16).</p>

<p class='c007'>When Christ first addressed these words to a few
poor fishermen, how unlikely it was that the promise
should be fulfilled? Yet it has been most wonderfully
verified. So it will be in our case also if we trust in
God. Yet two thirds of mankind are still pagans.
Zeal is needed.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. What must we do to spread the love
of God?</i> We need not do any novel thing; we must
follow the beaten path, travel along the highroad of
our religious life. <span lang="la"><i>Age quod agis</i></span>; perform your
daily duties; but do everything well, to the best of
your power.</p>

<p class='c007'>In particular realize in your conduct that,</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>You are to be the light of the world.</i> For this
purpose you must form your intellect upon the teachings
of Christ. Master His views of time and eternity,
by earnest meditations, sound readings, recollection,
much prayer. Do not contract false views of
life by following false guides, reading worldly authors
extensively, imbibing their spirit. The light that is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>in you, your intimate convictions, will necessarily
shine around you, through your language, through
your conduct. If you are thoroughly religious, real
Jesuits, it will be the light of Christ, and will truly enlighten
the portion of the world where Providence will
place you. If your views are false, you will not do
God’s work.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>You are the salt of the earth</i>; incorrupt yourselves,
you must keep others from corruption. This
requires pure and holy affections of the heart, soundness
of the will. If we Jesuits, with our training do
not live innocent and holy lives, what remedy can we
find? “If the salt lose its savor, wherewith shall it
be salted? It is good for nothing any more but to be
cast out, and to be trodden on by men” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>,
13). These words were spoken by Christ in the Sermon
on the Mount, when He was laying down the
platform of His campaign for the conquest of the
world to the Kingdom of His Father. We are soldiers
in that campaign. How worthy is our conduct
of such a cause and such a King.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with our Divine Lord, promising fidelity
and zealous exertions in this lofty vocation.</p>
<h3 id='trid-c-6' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='six'>VI</abbr> <br> Devotion to the Blessed Virgin</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> See the Blessed Virgin exalted in
Heaven, surrounded by the Saints and the Blessed of
our Society.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg for an increase of devotion to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>her, invoking her under the title of Queen of the Society
of Jesus.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Why is all the Church so devoted to
Mary?</i> Because God wishes to be honored by man
especially in connection with the grandest exhibition
of His love for man, the mystery of the Incarnation.
Now in this mystery Mary holds a most prominent
place; she is the key to the proper understanding of it.
Besides, as Jesus was given to mankind through Mary,
so through her He is given to individual souls. Therefore
the Church salutes her as “Mother of Divine
Grace”; and many holy writers say that every grace
comes to all individual souls through her intercession.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>How do we know that God is pleased with so great
a devotion to Mary?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. From the constant teaching of the Church, which
has applied to her such texts as these: “He that shall
find me shall find life and shall have salvation from the
Lord” (<abbr title='Proverbs'>Prov.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii,</abbr> 35); “They that work by me shall
not sin” (<abbr title='Ecclesiasticus'>Ecclus.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-four'>xxiv</abbr>, 30); etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. From the Doctors of the Church, who have exhausted
all their resources of learning to inculcate this
devotion. Such are <abbr title='Saints'>Sts.</abbr> Augustine, Bernard, Liguori,
Anthoninus, Bonaventure, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. From the workings of the Holy Ghost, who has
fostered this devotion in the lives of numberless Saints
and of other highly favored servants of God, as well
as in the practice and prayers of the Church itself, and
the unanimous teachings of her theologians.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. From so many miracles performed through the
invocation of the Blessed Virgin in every land.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. What part has our Society taken in
fostering this devotion?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. A most conspicuous part. For instance <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius
ascribes his conversion to the vision he had
of her, he made himself her Knight at Montserrat,
he makes us meditate on her and pray to her in our
retreats.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. In the life and death of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Stanislaus, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Berchmans, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Alphonsus, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis Hieronymo
and, in fact, all her Saints and her great men generally.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. In her zeal to propagate devotions to Mary by
means of her Sodalities, her devotions of the month of
Mary, and countless writings of her ablest men. No
one is considered as a worthy member of our Order
who has not a marked devotion to Mary. How do I
strive to honor her? Is there any practice that I used
to perform in her honor that I have gradually abandoned?
What improvement can I make in this respect?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. In what does devotion to Mary
chiefly consist?</i> It is an acquired habit, the result of
countless acts of ours in compliance with the grace of
God. Such are:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The devout celebration of her festivals, preparing
for them by novenas and continuing them by the
celebration of their octaves;</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The daily recitation of the Rosary, or at least
of the third part of it, the Beads, of the Litany of the
Blessed Virgin and the Office of her Immaculate Conception;</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>3. The wearing of her scapular of Mount Carmel,
and of medals blessed in her honor;</p>

<p class='c007'>4. The recitation of set prayers to her at rising in
the morning and retiring at night, at the sound of the
Angelus bell, morning, noon and night;</p>

<p class='c007'>5. Fervent invocations during the day, especially
at the approach of temptations;</p>

<p class='c007'>6. Reading and meditation on her prerogatives;</p>

<p class='c007'>7. Conversing on the same, or in any way promoting
her devotion. We can render no greater service
to any one than to make him devout to the Blessed
Virgin Mary. Are we doing as much as we can in
this respect?</p>

<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Vividly picture to yourself <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John
Berchmans at his prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg for copious grace to imitate his
spirit of fervor.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider that in the sight of God <i>men
differ from one another only according to their interior
dispositions</i>: <span lang="la"><i>Omnis gloria filiae regis ab intus</i></span>,
“All the glory of the King’s daughter is within”
(<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 44). It matters nothing whether a person be
rich or poor, learned or ignorant, man or woman, old
or young, refined or uncultured, etc. We are apt to
forget this and to trust in some natural superiority, as
the world does. The Lord said to His prophet Samuel:
“I do not judge according to the look of man;
for man seeth those things that appear, but the Lord
beholdeth the heart” (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> Kings <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 7). The right
view of ourselves will be one of the great disillusionments
at death. Let us now strive to view ourselves
as we are in God’s sight.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Consider this truth in special examples</i>,
comparing a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Alphonsus Rodriguez with an
ordinary Jesuit, a Brother, a Father or a Scholastic.
How similar outside. How different within. Compare
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John Berchmans, a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John Francis Regis
with a Passaglia, a Tyrrell, etc., a mere boy, like <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Stanislaus, with a veteran religious of the ordinary
cast. This interior proper disposition of which the
Psalmist sings is apt to promote devotion, which <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Francis De Sales describes as follows: “Devotion is
nothing else but that spiritual agility and vivacity by
which charity works in us, or we by her, with alacrity
and affection; and as it is the business of charity to
make us observe all God’s commandments generally
and without exception, so it is the part of devotion to
make us observe them cheerfully and with diligence....
Devotion is the pleasure of pleasures, the queen
of virtues, and the perfection of charity. If charity
be milk, devotion is the cream; if charity be plant, devotion
is the flower; if charity be a precious stone, devotion
is its lustre; if charity be a rich balm, devotion
is its fragrance, yea the odor of sweetness which comforts
men and rejoices Angels” (“Devout Life,” chapter
1, 2). Do I cultivate this disposition in my heart
with proper earnestness?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Consider that the purpose of the
triduum is to renew this devotion within our hearts</i>,
its purity and its energy. Consider that God Himself
affords this opportunity, and invites you to profit by it.
His grace is ready to help you. What must you do
during these three days? Our Society lays the observances
before you which you are expected to follow.
In her name Father Vincent Caraffa says to
you: “Let each one, leaving alone all literary studies
(except the work prescribed) apply himself exclusively
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>to the improvement of the spirit. Certain practices
in particular are pointed out, namely perfect
silence as far as possible, half an hour daily of truly
devout reading, half an hour likewise of earnest examination
of conscience, special meditations on the renewal
of the spirit of piety, a manifestation of conscience,
a confession of the faults committed since the
last renovation and a public accusation of defects.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Remember in all this the saying of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius:
“The more generous we shall show ourselves towards
God, the more generous we shall find God towards us,
and the more fit we shall daily be to receive in greater
abundance His graces and spiritual gifts.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Ask eagerly and confidently for the
grace of making a fervent triduum.</p>
<h3 id='trid-d-2' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='two'>II</abbr> <br> The Interior Spirit</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine Christ speaks to you from
the tabernacle, offering to be your teacher in the spiritual
life.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg of our dear Lord to teach you
in what consists the interior spirit which is to be renewed
during the triduum.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. In what consists that interior spirit?</i>
It is described in Holy Writ under the name of “Wisdom,”
and the entire book called “Wisdom” is occupied
in praising and explaining it. For instance, its
seventh chapter says: “I called upon God, and the
spirit of wisdom came upon me, and I preferred her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>before kingdoms and thrones, and esteemed riches
nothing in comparison of her.... Now all good
things came to me together with her.... She is an
infinite treasure to men, which they that use become
the friends of God, being commended for the gift of
discipline” (<abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 7-14).</p>

<p class='c007'>Wisdom is the virtue by which we direct our acts
by the best means to the best end, which is the end
for which we were created, the glory of God. This
is the spirit of our Society, “All for the Greater Glory
of God.” And this is the spirit which we must renew
within us by the exercises of the triduum. It regards
the purpose or intention for which we act, and therefore
it is called “the interior spirit.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. What is opposed to the interior spirit?</i>
Two classes of faults are opposed to this interior
spirit,</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Those by which we seek sinful gratifications,</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Those which simply fail to direct our actions to
our supernatural end. Supposing that we are careful
to avoid all wilful sin, let us consider how we can be
wanting in the interior spirit. There are various
ways: (<abbr class='spell'>a</abbr>) We may be actuated in many of our actions
by the love of praise, not seeking to please God
but to please ourselves. Of course all that is done for
a merely natural purpose is so much labor lost for
eternity: “Take heed that you do not your justice
before men, to be seen by them; otherwise you shall
not have a reward of your Father who is in heaven
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 1). Thus a religious, whether a
Father, a Scholastic or a Brother, may give great satisfaction
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>to his superiors, to his brethren and to outsiders,
and yet have little merit before God.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The country is full of able and energetic teachers,
for instance, who work only for earthly rewards.</p>

<p class='c007'>(<abbr class='spell'>b</abbr>) We may lead a life of mere impulsive energy,
getting interested in our work, perhaps to the neglect
of higher duties, or we may be drawn by mere natural
affections: “If you love them that love you, what
reward shall you have? Do not even the publicans
this?” (ib. <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 46).</p>

<p class='c007'>(<abbr class='spell'>c</abbr>) In many of our actions we may be doing mere
routine work. If we began the task with a good intention,
though we continue it without further thought
of the same, this is not mere routine, but may be very
meritorious. The danger is that we may waste much
time and energy by merely mechanical action without
any supernatural intention. Do I strive earnestly to
live for God, <abbr class='spell'>A.M.D.G.</abbr>?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. What means can I use for this purpose?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. Good daily meditations, by which I keep supernatural
motives before my mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Careful examinations of conscience, watching
in particular the motives of my actions.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Earnest prayer for light and grace steadily to
advance in sanctity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such prayer is suggested in various parts of the
“Book of Wisdom,” to which we referred before; for
instance, “Give me wisdom, that sitteth by thy throne,
and cast me not off from among thy children. For I
am thy servant and the son of thy handmaid, a weak
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>man and of short time, and falling short of the understanding
of judgment and laws. For if one be perfect
among the children of men, yet if thy wisdom
be not with him, he shall be nothing regarded” (<abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>,
4-6).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> An earnest petition for grace to renew
and increase our interior spirit.</p>
<h3 id='trid-d-3' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='three'>III</abbr> <br> The Interior Spirit Is Fostered by Faith</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Recall the words of Christ: “Amen,
amen, I say unto you, He that believeth in me hath
everlasting life” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 47).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask earnestly for an intense spirit
of faith.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider the value of faith in the sight
of God.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. It is one of the theological virtues, which are
infused into our hearts by the Holy Ghost: and thus,
coming from God they have a Divine efficacy. Therefore
whatever action is prompted by faith has supernatural
merit, that is deserves an eternal reward.
Hence the teaching of Christ: “He that believeth in
me hath everlasting life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>2. This value of faith is praised most highly by
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul, who devotes to its praise the whole eleventh
chapter of his Epistle to the Hebrews, showing how
all the Saints of the Old Law were sanctified by their
belief in the promised Redeemer.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. On the part of man, faith is the sacrifice of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>highest faculty, his understanding, to his sovereign
Lord. By it we resign our own judgment to accept in
its place the word of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. It is also the exercise of the virtue of humility,
by which we acknowledge the weakness of our intellect.
Now we know that “God resisteth the proud
and giveth grace to the humble” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 6).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. See how faith sanctifies our daily life</i>:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. It keeps before us the Divine presence wherever
we be; as a sponge plunged into the sea has water all
around it and within the pores of its substance, so we
are in God; “For in him we live and move and be”
(Acts <abbr title='seventeen'>xvii</abbr>, 28). Aie, God is still more intimately
present to us than the water is to the sponge, for He
penetrates every particle of our substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Faith reveals to us the real presence of Christ
in the Holy Eucharist, with body and soul, humanity
and Divinity, teaching us to adore Him, to offer Him
as our sacrifice and receive Him as our food.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Faith makes us recognize the voice of God in
the words of our rules and the directions of our superiors,
and thus it makes the details of our religious
life full of merit.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Faith pierces the guise of misery and frailty,
and makes us recognize in every human being the hidden
presence of Him who will say at the judgment:
“Amen I say to you, as long as you did it to one of
these my least brethren, you did it to me” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr>
<abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv</abbr>, 40).</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus faith makes the religious life most meritorious.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Examine yourselves on the practical
working of the spirit</i> of faith in your daily life. Consider:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Whether you strive earnestly to practise the
presence of God, by frequently remembering Him and
honoring Him by some ejaculatory prayer; for instance,
at the striking of the clock, or at the signal to
begin or end an exercise. If in your own room, offer
each new task kneeling to your loving Lord and His
Holy Mother.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Do you visit the Blessed Sacrament frequently
and lovingly, attend Mass devoutly, and receive Holy
Communion daily, with proper preparation and
thanksgiving?</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Are you diligent in keeping your rules and docile
to the directions of your superiors? Or do you
criticise their orders, thereby showing that you fail to
recognize in them the voice of God?</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Do you treat all your brethren with generous
charity, seeing in them so many images of Christ?
Or do you take a merely human view of them, being
very fond of some and cold towards others, as worldlings
treat one another? Do you endeavor to benefit
and console all those in need or in sorrow?</p>

<p class='c007'>The days of the renovation of spirit offer a golden
opportunity to examine the motives of all our actions,
valuing them all according to the teachings of faith.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with our dear Lord, begging for much
light and grace to lead a life of lively faith, and thus
to be thoroughly renewed in spirit.</p>

  <h3 id='trid-d-4' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr> <br> The Interior Spirit Is Fostered by Hope</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Recall the words of the Psalmist:
“Trust in the Lord, and do good.... Delight in the
Lord, and He will give thee the requests of thy heart”
(<abbr title='Psalm'>Ps.</abbr> 36).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for a lively confidence in the
help of God to lead a holy and successful life.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. The virtue of hope inspires lofty aspirations.</i>
All men must hope for such graces from
God as will enable them to attain the ends to which
they are called. But as religious, and as Jesuits we
are certainly called to attain perfection for ourselves
and abundant fruit in the souls of others. Unless a
Jesuit aims at these two objects, he falls below the
mark of his vocation; He is a spiritual abortion. All
other aims are trivial in comparison. That we are
called to this twofold success is declared by the second
rule of the Summary; and therefore the words of
Christ are meant for us: “I have chosen you and
have appointed you that you should go and should
bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 16). This lofty aim is the spirit of our
vocation. It is fostered by the virtue of hope.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. The virtue of hope gives us confidence
of success.</i> The sanctification of our own soul and of
many others is certainly above the power of any man.
If therefore we had not the help of God for this purpose,
we could not attain this effect. But with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>help of God we can do wonders: “I can do all things
in him who strengthened me” (<abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 13). Two
sentiments must combine in me for the purpose: an
intimate conviction of my total inability to save souls,
and a firm confidence in the power and goodness of
God to effect this result through my weakness: “The
foolish things of the world hath God chosen, that He
may confound the strong; and the base things of the
world and the things that are contemptible hath God
chosen, and things that are not, that he might bring
to naught things that are; that no flesh should glory
in his sight” (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 27-29). The more humble
our opinion of ourselves and the more lively our confidence
in God, the more earnest no doubt will be our
efforts to sanctify ourselves and others, and thus the
more we shall foster in us the spirit of our vocation.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. To attain supernatural results we
must trust in the use of supernatural means.</i> All the
Philosophy of the world cannot convert a Pagan; nor
all theology a Protestant, nor all literature a sinner.
Conversion and sanctification are the work of grace.
Now grace is obtained by prayer, by sacrifice, self-immolation,
mortification. This lesson our dear Lord
teaches us with much emphasis, saying: “Amen,
amen I say to you, unless the grain of wheat falling
into the ground die, itself remaineth alone; but if it
die, it bringeth forth much fruit” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>, 24,
25). The minister of God is like a grain of wheat;
as the wheat must be cast into the moist and hot furrow
and corrupt before it can produce a new and fertile
plant, so God’s minister must not spare himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>but be mortified and suffer debasement before he can
produce abundant fruit in souls. Still remember that
study and work, when done for supernatural motives,
become thereby supernatural means, and are then as
good as prayer, and often better than prayer. For
whoever would neglect his appointed tasks to give extra
time to prayer would not please the Lord. Hard
work in the service of God is our habitual duty;
through it we must sanctify ourselves and others.
One of the sayings attributed to <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius is:
“Work as if all your successes were going to depend
on your own efforts; and trust in God as if all depended
on Him, nothing on yourself.” And of course
where all depends on the infinite power and goodness
of God, we may expect abundant fruit.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with our dear Lord, begging for a lively
hope in His assistance.</p>
<h3 id='trid-d-5' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='five'>V</abbr> <br> The Interior Spirit Is Fostered by Charity</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> See the glorified members of our Society
around Jesus in Heaven, looking down on us
with tender affection.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg for a liberal share of the spirit
of love.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Consider that <i>perfection consists in the
love of God</i>; therefore whatever increases the love of
God within us increases our perfection, fosters our interior
spirit. To increase this love of God, let us
study its excellence: it makes us really friends of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>Christ, who said to His Apostles, and says to all who
strive to imitate their example: “I will not now call
you servants, for the servant knoweth not what his
Lord doth. But I have called you friends, because all
things whatsoever I have heard of my Father I have
made known to you” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 15). Has not
Christ given to the true Jesuit an intimate knowledge
of Himself? Does He not treat us all as His true
friends, rather than servants? The servant is simply
expected to obey orders without knowing the why and
the wherefore, without understanding what it is all
about. To us Christ has given, through the Exercises
of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, a clear insight into the entire plan of
sanctification, which even our Brothers and our novices
soon get to understand remarkably well. Should
we not then highly appreciate this Divine light and
faithfully walk in its radiance?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. This friendship with God has various
degrees of perfection</i>:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. The lowest degree of friendship is that which
at least avoids all that would so offend a friend as to
sever the friendship entirely, and rather turn it into
hatred. In case of our friendship with God, this
severance is produced by any mortal sin. Of course
a true Jesuit commits no mortal sins. Any one who
would commit such sins frequently has fallen below
the normal standard of religious life.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. The second degree of friendship excludes all
that offends a friend deliberately, with full knowledge
and consent, though in a matter of minor importance.
This is done by fully deliberate venial sin. This degree
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>of friendship with God should be the normal condition
of every good religious.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The third degree of friendship strives to avoid
all that may displease a friend in any matter whatever,
even when there is no question of giving offense.
Such is the condition of fervent religious, who observe
all their rules with great exactness, even those that do
not bind under sin. They do so generously through
the spirit of love for their Lord.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. A fourth degree of friendship exists in those
persons who are ever eager to give pleasures to their
friends, never sparing any trouble to do so. Examine
what is your habitual, or at least predominant disposition
towards our good Lord. Do you often offend
Him with full knowledge and will? Can you be more
generous in doing what will please Him? What improvements
can you make?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Consider how friendship is increased.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. By thinking frequently of the good qualities of
our friend, of the favors he has done us, of the
warmth of his affection for us and the proofs he has
given us of it. Therefore we meditate on the Person,
the life and the sufferings of Christ, His Blessed
Mother and the Saints. Can I make my meditations
more fervent and more loving? For the same purpose
we should read spiritual books and make ourselves
familiar with devotional literature, carry on spiritual
conversations when it can be done with profit, and
collect notes of edifying matters for future use.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. By emptying our hearts of all human attachments
that God may fill them entirely. The Lord is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>jealous lover. Perfect detachment from creatures is
the condition of perfect love of God.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. By making frequent acts of perfect resignation
to the Divine will. For friendship between two persons
consists mainly in union of wills.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Ask earnestly for an increase of love of
God, and resolve to avoid all that may hinder it.</p>
<h3 id='trid-d-6' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='six'>VI</abbr> <br> The Interior Spirit Is Fostered by the Holy Ghost</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you hear Christ say: “You
shall receive the power of the Holy Ghost coming upon
you” (Acts <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 5).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask earnestly that the Holy Ghost
may effect in you a thorough renovation of spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider what the Holy Ghost did for
the Apostles.</i> Though they had been taught by Christ
for three years, they had still understood His doctrine
very imperfectly; their affections were still earthly,
set on worldly greatness; their dispositions were cowardly.
What did they need? A copious infusion of
light and strength. We are in a similar situation.
They obtained this grace by earnest prayer: “All
these were persevering with one mind in prayer” (ib.
14). In due time the effect followed: “And they
were all filled with the Holy Ghost” (ib. <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 4).
From that moment they understood all the doctrine
correctly; and, after being scourged before the council,
“They indeed went from the presence of the council,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>rejoicing that they were accounted worthy to suffer
reproach for the name of Jesus” (ib. <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 41). This
was only the beginning of their heroic lives.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Consider what the Holy Ghost does in
the Church to-day.</i> The work of sanctification of the
faithful, begun by the descent of the Holy Ghost upon
the Apostles, was to be continued till the end of time,
and is so continued in us. Just as He has given us
sanctifying grace in Baptism, and has constantly increased
the same in a multitude of various ways up to
the present day, so He is determined to continue this
Divine work in our hearts, and to lead us to the practice
of all the virtues proper to our state of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>In particular He wishes to bestow on us the
Seven Gifts of the Holy Ghost. The very name of
“Gift” shows that we are not expected to acquire those
excellent qualities by our own exertions. They may
be compared to the sails attached to a boat, or to the
steam or electricity propelling a machine. It is thus
the Holy Ghost makes the practice of virtue easy for
those who implore His assistance. Have we not all
experienced this in many ways? In particular in embracing
the religious state? What God has begun in
us He will not desist from, provided in the future as
in the past we co-operate with His graces.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. What co-operation does the Holy
Ghost expect from us?</i> We have seen that the sanctification
of the soul comes chiefly from the Holy Ghost.
Yet He ordinarily requires our co-operation. In what
does this consist?</p>

<p class='c007'>1. In complying with the inspirations of His grace.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>This supposes that we carefully avoid all wilful sins.
By mortal sins we would drive Him entirely from our
souls; by deliberate venial sins we oppose His work,
turning to creatures and attaching ourselves to them,
thus opposing His efforts to unite our will with God’s,
in which union sanctity consists. By indeliberate
venial sins also we resist His influence, but to a less
degree. Yet we must also strive to diminish their
frequency. Then acting on the promptings of grace,
we shall perform a multitude of virtuous acts, by which
the Holy Spirit will advance us to ever higher sanctity.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Our co-operation consists in the second place in
the fervor of our prayers, that is in all manner of
direct intercourse with God by any of our spiritual
exercises, or by aspirations after God or His gifts, uttered
in the midst of distracting occupations. For
these direct dealings with God are the ordinary means
which He provides for the supply of light and strength
to the soul, enabling it to lead a fervent and faithful
life. Our prayers become all the more efficient in this
regard when they are combined with the sacramental
graces derived from confession, Holy Communion, the
Holy Mass or visits to the Blessed Sacrament.</p>

<p class='c007'>Am I thus faithfully and fervently co-operating
with the influence of the Holy Ghost? What can be
improved?</p>

<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you see the graveyard of the
Novitiate.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask grace to view all things as those
buried there view them at present.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider the vast amount of good
done by those buried there</i>, the fruit produced in
countless souls by their labors in missions, churches,
colleges, parochial schools, retreats given, sermons delivered,
confessions heard, the last sacraments administered,
the sick visited, youths prepared for the priesthood
and the religious life, etc., etc. All these results
are still spreading farther and wider, like the ripples
on a pond and last from generation to generation.
And by their faithful observance of rules, the labors
borne, the sufferings endured, the penance practiced,
their acts of charity, humility, piety, etc., they have
also accumulated immense rewards for themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Consider the heavenly reward now
enjoyed</i> by their souls in company with the Saints and
the Blessed, with Jesus, Mary and Joseph. How light
appear to them now their former sacrifices. How
fully they now realize the meaning of these words of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span><abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul: “The sufferings of this time are not worthy
to be compared with the glory to come, that shall
be revealed in us” (<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='eight'>viii,</abbr> 18). Think also of
the multitudes of souls who are now in bliss with them,
and who owe their salvation to the labors and prayers
of those of our brethren whose remains lie in this
sacred ground.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Consider how little is known now of
their individual endowments.</i> To most of the present
generation of our younger members few of the
names upon those tombstones recall any former memories.
All that is now appreciated by their successors
is the grand cause for which they lived and died.
Their bodily forms, their more or less extensive
knowledge, their wit, their poetic power, their eloquence,
their taste for music, their talent for mathematics,
even the distinguished offices they held, the
great services they rendered to the Society and to the
Church at large, all, or at least most of this is forgotten
by the present generation. And so will be the
distinctions which you may acquire during your lifetime
to the generations to come. Only that which
pleases the eye of God is of real and lasting value.
Reflect whether you are not too much in love with temporal
distinctions. Resolve to make a thorough self-examination
during the three days before you, weighing
all concerns in the balance of eternity.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you hear Christ say: “Pray
ye the Lord of the harvest that he send forth laborers
into his harvest” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>, 38).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask grace to renew your spirit of
zeal for souls.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> The salvation of souls is the most
earnest desire of the Sacred Heart of Jesus. It was
the purpose for which He came down to earth, which
was ever before Him during His private life, His
preaching, His sufferings and His death; and it is still
the object of His intercession for us in Heaven. For
He realizes, better than any one else, the immense interests
at stake in saving souls. This is the reason of
His infinite self-humiliation, His boundless self-sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'>This grand work He wishes to be continued by His
ministers, to whom He says: “Feed my lambs, feed
my sheep.” To do this work He has ever since inspired
His dearest friends: the Apostles, all missionaries
and pastors, numberless Saints in all ages and all
lands.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. This eagerness is as earnest with Him
to-day as it ever was.</i> It is so in particular for this
land of ours, where the fields are certainly white for
the harvest. And for this work Christ has chosen
you: “You have not chosen me, but I have chosen
you; and have appointed you that you should go and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>bring forth fruit, and your fruit should remain” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
John <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 16). It would be a deplorable blindness
in us if we failed to understand the importance of the
work before us, and not only a sad but a guilty listlessness
if we were to set our minds on selfish trifles, and
not profit by the golden opportunity offered us to do
God’s work and labor generously at the salvation of
souls every day of our lives. Of course you cannot at
the present stage of your religious life, go forth and
preach and give missions and bring non-Catholics
into the fold, nor are you urged to do things extraordinary.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. What can you do in your present
circumstances to lead zealous lives? What does God
desire of you?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. You must acquire thoroughly the spirit of our
institute. You are still in the stage of formation to
this spirit. Christ had called His first disciples with
the words: “Come after me, and I will make you fishers
of men” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 17). So He has called you
for the same purpose. Yet He did not send them at
once to preach; He kept them in training, instructing
and directing them. So He is doing with you. Do
not pretend to know better than those put over you;
do not criticise and murmur at any time; but pray
much to obtain fully the spirit of our Society. Do so
particularly during this meditation and this whole
triduum.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Do the tasks entrusted to you with much zeal and
devotedness. All the labor in which any Jesuit is employed
by his superiors bears, in some way or other, on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>the salvation of souls. Do all your tasks in that spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>The military recruit, while in training in the barracks,
is already serving his country. His duty is to do
it well. You are in the service of Christ the King. For
His sake do all to the best of your power. If He intrusts
to you some care of your neighbor, as He did to
His Apostles and the seventy-two disciples during their
time of training, remember it is God’s work you are
doing, as aids to Christ, for the salvation of precious
souls. Do it all carefully, faithfully, making generously
the sacrifices involved in the performance of
your duties.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Pray for God’s help and His blessings on your
labors and on the labors of your brethren. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis
Xavier ascribed his wonderful success in pagan
lands to the prayers of his brethren in Europe; and no
doubt the missionaries of the present day are likewise
assisted by the prayers of the whole Society. This is
the very Spirit of the Apostleship of Prayer, the zealous
exercise of which is sufficient to make you all apostles
of the Lord.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider our strict obligation to observe
fraternal charity.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. Without it there is no sanctifying grace in the
soul. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John writes: “We know that we have
passed from death to life because we love the brethren.
He that loveth not abideth in death. He that hateth
his brother is a murderer” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 14-15).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Christ has chosen this commandment as distinctly
His own: “A new commandment I give unto
you. Love one another as I have loved you” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
John <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>, 34), and again: “This is my commandment
that you love one another as I have loved you”
(ib. <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 12).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. He makes its observance the distinctive mark
of His disciples: “By this shall all men know that
you are my disciples, if you have love one for another”
(ib. <abbr title='thirteen'>xiii</abbr>, 34).</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Without a delicate fraternal charity many religious
communities would contain some very unhappy
members. And our Society in particular has always
shown the greatest solicitude to protect and foster this
virtue.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. How may fraternal charity be violated?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Among religious, violations of charity are not so
often committed by actions as they are among seculars,
but they are not seldom committed by word or
thought. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James writes: “In many things we all
offend. If any man offendeth not in word, the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>is a perfect man” (<abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 2), and again: “The tongue
no man can tame, an unquiet evil, a deadly poison” (ib.
8). By calling it a deadly poison, he clearly indicates
that the tongue is often the cause of grievous wrong.
Now wilfully to inflict a grievous wrong on a neighbor
is a grievous sin. But even when the wrong done is
of less moment, it is always sinful to some extent.
Charity is violated in many ways.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. By needlessly saying in the hearing of another
words that give him pain; and that whether he be our
equal or our inferior, and still more if he be our superior.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. By needlessly making known another’s secret
faults.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. By imputing to another a fault he has not committed;
this is called calumny, or slander, and is a
twofold sin, adding the violation of truth to that of
charity.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. By putting an unfavorable interpretation on a
neighbor’s conduct, expressing it in words.</p>

<p class='c007'>5. By condemning him in our minds only, beyond
the evidence of the facts; such a judgment is rash,
even if it be not false.</p>

<p class='c007'>6. By needlessly suspecting evil of which there is
no good proof.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. How we should practise fraternal
Charity.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>We must earnestly make up our minds, and act on
the conviction all our lives, that the practice of charity
is not a mere devotion, highly recommended but
not essential for the attainment of solid virtue. <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Peter writes: “Before all things have a constant mutual
charity among yourselves” (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Peter'>Pet.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 8). Our
Divine Lord in His vivid description of the Last
Judgment lays the chief stress on the duty of charity,
and says: “As long as you did it to one of these my
least brethren, you did it to me” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty-five'>xxv</abbr>, 40).
Again He says: “Love your enemies, do good to
those who hate you, bless them that curse you, and
pray for them that calumniate you.... As you
would that men should do to you, do you also to them
in like manner” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Luke <abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 27-31). And He has
made our generous disposition to forgive others the
condition of our own pardon, teaching us to pray in
the Our Father: “Forgive us our trespasses as we
forgive them who trespass against us.” Through <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Peter He tells us that: “Charity covers a multitude
of sins.” And what is better still, charity prevents us
from committing a multitude of sins. If you can
accustom yourself never to say an unkind word of or
to another, nor think evil of any one, you are on the
highroad to sanctity.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Beg of our dear Lord the grace of a
generous, delicate and universal charity.</p>
<h3 id='trid-e-4' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr> <br> The Spirit of Sacrifice</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold the scene on Calvary, as Jesus
exclaims: “It is consummated.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask eagerly for the spirit of sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider that all our blessings have
been the result of sacrifices.</i> When Adam had ruined
our race by selfish indulgence, the Son of God restored
us to favor by the most tremendous spirit of
sacrifice. His blessings to mankind were propagated
from land to land and from age to age by men distinguished
for the spirit of sacrifice; the Apostles, the
Martyrs, the missionaries, the founders of religious
Orders, the saintly bishops and priests, to the present
day. If we wish to take our share of this glorious
task of saving souls, it can only be done by making
sacrifices. The minister of Christ who shirks the toils
and the privations of his vocation produces little fruit:
“Unless the grain of wheat falling into the ground die,
itself remaineth alone; but if it die it bringeth forth
much fruit.... If any man minister to me, let him
follow me” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>, 24-26).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. The spirit of sacrifice is necessary for
our salvation and sanctification.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. For our salvation. For a person who is not
accustomed to refuse himself many, even lawful, indulgences
is very likely to fall into temptations and
grievous sins. Therefore Holy Job said: “I made
a covenant with my eyes that I would not so much
as think upon a virgin” (<abbr title='thirty-one'>xxxi</abbr>, 1). On the other
hand, Solomon said of himself: “Whatsoever my
eyes desired, I refused them not; and I withheld not
my heart from enjoying every pleasure, and delighting
itself in the things which I had prepared” (<abbr title='Ecclesiastes'>Eccles.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>,
10). The result was that Solomon, “the wise man”
by excellence, the special favorite of God at first, fell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>afterwards into most grievous sins: “And when he
was now old his heart was turned away by women
to follow strange gods ... he worshipped Astarthe .. and
Moloch,” etc. (3 Kings <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 4-8); and it is
not certain that he saved his soul. History and constant
experience teach, by frequent examples, that the
spirit of sacrifice is necessary to secure our salvation.
And our Divine Lord declares in express terms that
“The kingdom of heaven suffereth violence, and the
violent bear it away” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='eleven'>xi</abbr>, 12).</p>

<p class='c007'>2. This violence, or the spirit of sacrifice, is still
more necessary to work out our sanctification. For
this is to be achieved by the imitation of Christ, who
says: “If any one will come after me, let him deny
himself, and take up his cross and follow me” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 24). And it is an axiom of the spiritual
life that one advances in virtue in proportion to the
violence he does to himself. Therefore the religious
life, which is the school of perfection, calls at every
step for generous sacrifices in the observance of that
multitude of rules whose very purpose is the sanctification
of the soul by the spirit and the practice of sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. How should we practise the spirit of
sacrifice?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. By carefully observing all our rules. This observance
of the rules implies a multitude of self-sacrifices;
so that <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John Berchmans declared that the
common life was his greatest mortification; and the
oration of this Saint’s Office exalts him for his fidelity
in the service of God.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>2. By hard labor in performing the duties imposed
on us, especially when these are of an unpleasant kind;
for then they require more sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. By rendering all the services we can, even when
they are not imposed on us, making ourselves as useful
as possible. It is a common saying that what is
every man’s business is no one’s business, and thus
many services are neglected. But a good religious
rather says: this ought to be done, and no one in particular
is appointed to do it; so I must do it.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. By making all sacrifices cheerfully: “For God
loveth a cheerful giver” (2 <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>, 7).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Ask earnestly for a cheerful spirit of
sacrifice.</p>
<h3 id='trid-e-5' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='five'>V</abbr> <br> Become Men of Prayer</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold Christ rapt in prayer: “He
passed the whole night in the prayer of God” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Luke, <abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 12).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Earnestly ask the grace of becoming
a man of prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider the importance of praying
well.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. Our life is, or at least ought to be, so very supernatural
that it needs an uncommon amount of
grace to lead it properly. Now the ordinary condition
that God requires to impart His grace is prayer, not
so much long prayer as good prayer. If we pray well,
we shall undoubtedly receive much grace.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>2. Our days are filled up with distracting occupations,
so that long hours pass in worldly cares or with
profane objects of thought, whose natural tendency
is to engross our hearts with worldly affections, and
turn them from the Creator to the creature. Prayer,
fervent prayer, is the most efficient means to counteract
this tendency. Without it we soon lose sight of
our highest interests and commit at least venial sins.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. The good we shall do to the souls of others depends
chiefly on prayer; for as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius teaches us,
it is from the interior that force must flow to the exterior
for the end proposed to us (Summary, rule 16).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. What aids have we to become men of
prayer?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. We have the Holy Ghost, who helps us to pray,
crying in our hearts “Abba, Father” (<abbr title='Galatians'>Gal.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 6). He
is certainly ever ready to help us to become men of
prayer; for we Jesuits are called to this, since it is our
vocation to teach others how to pray, and thus to form
spiritual men.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. We possess a most perfect system of prayer,
given us through <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius in his Spiritual Exercises.
This has been a most rich and inexhaustible
source of spirituality, as is shown in the works of our
writers, and the lives of our Fathers, Scholastics and
Brothers through all the periods of our history.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. All we need to become men of prayer ourselves
is diligent application to its practice. To obtain distinguished
success in any art or science we need special
diligence and a sort of enthusiasm in the practice of
that pursuit. He who earnestly wishes to become a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>man of prayer,—and we ought all to desire this,—should
make it his special ambition to perform all his
spiritual exercises to the best of his power, and constantly
to ask the Lord for the gift of prayer. What
is my conduct in this respect? Am I really in earnest
to acquire that science of the Saints? What improvements
am I going to make in this matter?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. What hinders us from being men of
prayer?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>Not our duties, as is the case with most worldlings.
For, although, as we have stated before, our outward
duties are apt, to some extent, to turn our minds and
hearts from God to creatures, enough time for prayer
is left us to repair our spiritual strength day by day,
provided we perform our meditations, examinations
of conscience, etc., with becoming fervor. In fact,
our outward labors, if animated by the proper intention,
which our spiritual exercises constantly inspire,
will be helpful to bring us nearer to God, just as bodily
labor helps the food to promote bodily health. But
what hinders us from becoming men of prayer is:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. Indolence, which manifests itself in various
ways. We may not prepare the points of meditation
over night with proper diligence, or neglect to call them
to mind before falling asleep and again at rising in
the morning. We may fail to rise promptly and neglect
the morning visit to the Blessed Sacrament. We
may assume a listless posture during meditation and
at other times of prayer, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Inordinate passions; such as ambition, vain
glory, sensual attachments to persons, etc., which keep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>the imagination and the heart busy with other things
during the time of prayer.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Neglect of direct conversation with God while
He is giving us an audience. Prayer supposes that we
speak to Him, by acts of adoration, humility, thanksgiving,
petition, contrition, intercession, etc. We
need not say many things but yet we should speak
earnestly all along the time of the exercise, often
repeating the same sentiments.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> Ask for an increase of fidelity and fervor
in prayer.</p>
<h3 id='trid-e-6' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='six'>VI</abbr> <br> The Vine and the Branches</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine that Christ speaks to you
from the altar, and says: “I am the vine, you the
branches; he that abideth in me and I in Him, the
same beareth much fruit” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 5).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Beg to acquire an intimate union with
Christ.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider how powerless we are of
ourselves to save our souls, and those of other men.</i>
For Christ says: “As the branch cannot bear fruit
of itself, unless it abide in the vine, so neither can you
unless you abide in me” (<abbr title='Ibid'>Ib.</abbr> <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 4). The dogma is
this: we can do nothing profitable for Heaven, unless
we possess sanctifying grace and be helped by actual
grace. Now both of these come to us from Christ,
who is like the vine that sends forth its sap into the
branches and thus gives life and fertility. So too we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>cannot save the souls of others by human learning or
skill, unless Christ co-operates with us by His grace.
Otherwise we are but like sounding brass and tinkling
cymbals. If we do not constantly foster this union
with God, we waste much labor, as we shall, no doubt,
find at our death we have often done.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Consider on the other hand how
powerful we are when assisted by the grace of God.</i>
For Christ says: “He that abideth in me and I in
him, the same beareth much fruit.” How so? By
the Divine power which then makes use of us to do
its peculiar work of sanctification for ourselves and
others. Christ adds: “In this is my Father glorified,
that you bring forth very much fruit” (ib. <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 8).
“I have chosen you and have appointed you, that you
should go and should bring forth fruit and your fruit
should remain” (ib. <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 16).</p>

<p class='c007'>Our labors thus become His labors, as the sap of
the vine produces the fruit in the branches. Besides,
when our will is one with Christ’s will, our prayers
become most powerful, as He adds, saying: “If you
abide in me and my words abide in you, you shall ask
whatever you will, and it shall be done unto you” (ib.
<abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 7).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. How do we strengthen this supernatural
union with Christ?</i> He has deigned to tell us this
also, saying: “If you keep my commandments, you
shall abide in my love; as I also have kept my Father’s
commandments, and do abide in his love” (<abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 10).</p>

<p class='c007'>How consoling all this doctrine is! He adds again:
“You are my friends if you do the things that I command
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>you” (<abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 14). All we need do then to achieve
the most glorious results for our salvation and that of
others is to be obedient to His voice.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr>. Consider the absolute necessity of
this union with Christ.</i> For He assures us of this,
saying: “If any one abide not in me, he shall be cast
forth as a branch and shall wither; and they shall
gather him up and cast him into the fire, and he burneth.”
This is the lot of all who die in mortal sin, no
matter how holy they may have been before. Read
the <abbr title='fifteenth'>15th</abbr> chapter of Ezechiel.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy.</i> O Jesus, may this triduum unite me

<h3 id='trid-f-1' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='one'>I</abbr> <br> On the Vows</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine the scene of your first vows—the
ceremony is very simple, the meaning very solemn.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask a full appreciation of the meaning.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider the choice made by Jesus.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. While on earth Jesus chose His Apostles:
“Come ye after me, and I will make you to be fishers
of men” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 19); meaning: I will make
you my co-laborers in the grandest of all works; “I
have chosen you, that you should go and that you
should bring forth fruit, and your fruit should remain”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='fifteen'>xv</abbr>, 16), fruit for eternity. The
Apostles could not then realize the honor offered them.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Christ meant to make their hearts like to His
own in holiness, filling them with love for God and
men, generosity, humility, mildness, fidelity, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. He meant to make them ornaments of Heaven,
the twelve great constellations of the celestial Paradise.
Then consider that the same Blessed Saviour
has chosen you for the same three purposes. Acts of
thanks, self-abasement: “I, although most unworthy,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>prostrate before the feet of thy Divine majesty,
etc.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Consider what were your sentiments
at the time of your first vows.</i> They were most earnest
and sincere. You were of age, you knew the real
meaning, you had been tried, you had full liberty to
accept Christ’s offers or to refuse them, you were enlightened
by the grace of God and supported by His
aid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Yours were solemn words: “I do vow before the
most sacred Virgin Mary, and the whole court of
Heaven, to Thy Divine Majesty, perpetual Poverty,
Chastity and Obedience, etc.” These vows effected a
solemn consecration of your person, made you sacred,
like chalices, their violation a sacrilege. These days
are to prepare in you proper sentiments to renew this
pledge of a sacred Knighthood, like <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius’s
<i>night watch of arms</i> at Mont Serrat, really espousals
with the Son of God. The breaking of such a contract
is horrible before God and men. An unfaithful
religious is like a false coin—apparently gold, really
brass.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Have we been faithful?</i> There can
be no doubt of our original sincerity. Our self-immolation
was sincere and generous; God supported us.
Have we been living up to the lofty ideals with which
we started out? Thousands before us have done so;
thousands are doing so to-day; thousands are being
prepared by the Holy Spirit to do the same.</p>

<p class='c007'>These days are assigned us by our Society to examine
carefully how we stand. If we find defects, we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>are now to correct them. We must begin the task by
a careful self-examination. This is a visit, not of a
Father Provincial or Father General, but of the Holy
Ghost Himself to the hearts of all.</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt you are faithful in many things; see
whether you are faithful in all things. Imagine the
Holy Spirit addresses you in the words spoken in the
Apocalypse to the Bishop of Ephesus, saying: “I
know thy works and thy labor, and thy patience, and
how thou canst not bear them that are evil.... And
thou hast patience, and hast endured for my name,
and hast not fainted. But I have somewhat against
thee.” Then consider whether you find really in your
conduct something that needs special looking after
during these three days.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i>, according to the sentiments thus excited
in your mind.</p>
<h3 id='trid-f-2' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='two'>II</abbr> <br> The Vow of Chastity</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> See Christ in Heaven surrounded by
a bright crowd of intimate friends (<abbr title='Apocalypse'>Apoc.</abbr> <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 9).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for the most delicate purity of
heart.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>.</i> Chastity is a most precious treasure.
It was bestowed on Adam and Eve in Paradise:
“They were both naked, to wit Adam and Eve, and
they were not ashamed” (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 25). On the other
hand, when “All flesh had corrupted its way” (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr>
<abbr title='six'>vi</abbr>, 12) the Deluge showed the indignation of God;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and, soon after, to punish impurity, “The Lord rained
upon Sodom and Gomorha brimstone and fire ...
and he destroyed these cities” (<abbr title='Genesis'>Gen.</abbr> <abbr title='nineteen'>xix</abbr>, 24, 25).</p>

<p class='c007'>When the Son of God was about to come down
and become a child of this sin-stained race, He prepared
for Himself a temple of purity in the Blessed
Virgin Mary. His favorite friends were chaste virginal
souls, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joseph, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John the Baptist, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John
the Apostle; and His other Apostles too left their
wives and all things to follow Him. One of His first
teachings was: “Blessed are the clean of heart” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<abbr title='Matthew'>Matth.</abbr> <abbr title='five'>v</abbr>, 8). To teach the sanctity becoming the
human body, it is anointed with sacred oil at Baptism
and Confirmation, fed with the Divine Bread at Holy
Communion, incensed at Solemn Mass and at burial,
and laid in consecrated ground to rise again in
glory. How we ought to respect this vessel of election!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>.</i> We have been selected from among
thousands to constitute the virgin band of Christ’s intimate
friends. These are Divine nuptials of Jesus
with the consecrated virgin soul, united together into
closest union. To this holiness impurity is diametrically
opposed. As adultery is the grossest sin
against the sacred bond of matrimony, so is impurity
the most degrading vice against the religious state;
and as in <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Matthew’s Gospel (<abbr title='nineteen'>xix</abbr>, 9) marital infidelity
is a just cause for rejection of the guilty party,
so Jesus rejects the impure. The Book of Wisdom
also declares that “Wisdom will not dwell in a body
subject to sins” (<abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 4).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. Means to protect and perfect purity.</i></p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>Prayer.</i> The Book of Wisdom says: “As I
knew that I could not otherwise be continent except
God gave it, and this also was a point of wisdom to
know whose gift it was, I went to the Lord and besought
him” (<abbr title='eight'>viii</abbr>, 21). This is one strong reason
why religious should do so much more praying than
seculars, that they are vowed to a life of perpetual
purity. In particular there is need in this matter of
habitual recourse to prayer at every assault of temptation.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>The practice of mortification</i>; for to the spirit
of impurity apply the words of Christ: “This kind
can go out by nothing but by prayer and fasting” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Mark <abbr title='nine'>ix</abbr>, 28).</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Modesty of all the senses, especially of the
eyes: “I made a covenant with my eyes, that I would
not so much as think upon a virgin,” said Holy Job
(<abbr title='thirty-one'>xxxi</abbr>, 1), clearly indicating that the source of evil
thoughts lies chiefly in the objects presented to the
eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>4. <i>Avoiding the occasions</i> of temptations; for,
while many other passions are best subdued by direct
resistance to their promptings, that of lust must be
overcome by flight. Therefore Ecclesiasticus warns
us that “he that loveth danger shall perish in it” (<abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>,
27). Few servants of God had shown such heroic
proofs of fidelity to duty amid multiplied and protracted
trials as had King David; and yet the imprudence
with which he exposed himself to an impure
temptation made him in a few days an adulterer, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>tyrant and a murderer, and filled his remaining years
of life with bitter sufferings.</p>

<p class='c007'>We must carefully consider in every retreat how
faithfully we make use of these various protections of
angelic chastity; for “We have this treasure in earthen
vessels” (2 <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='four'>iv</abbr>, 7).</p>

<h3 id='trid-f-3' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='three'>III</abbr> <br> The Vow of Obedience</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold Christ learning a trade from
<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Joseph.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for high appreciation of obedience.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. Consider that all human beings must
obey.</i> A wise God must establish order in all His
works; hence the maxim: “Order is Heaven’s first
law.” The material universe obeys the law of gravitation,
the moral universe obeys the law of subordination
of wills of inferiors to superiors, that is the
law of obedience. Common sense teaches all mankind
that children must obey their parents, servants their
masters, subjects their lords, etc. When God came
to share your nature, He put Himself to obey, and
carried this virtue to the highest perfection, “becoming
obedient unto death, even to the death of the
cross” (<abbr title='Philippians'>Phil.</abbr> <abbr title='two'>ii</abbr>, 8). In positive legislation God has
made this law universal. The Fourth Commandment
directly enforces it (<abbr title='Exodus'>Ex.</abbr> <abbr title='twenty'>xx</abbr>, 12). The law of Deuteronomy
is still more forcible, saying: “He that will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>be proud and refuse to obey the commandment of the
priest who ministereth at the time to the Lord thy
God, and the decree of the judge, that man shall die,
and thou shalt take away the evil from Israel” (<abbr title='seventeen'>xvii</abbr>,
12); and laying down the law for sacred services, God
inflicted a sudden and disgraceful death on two young
priests for using common instead of sacred fire (<abbr title='Leviticus'>Levit.</abbr>
<abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 1-3). He wished to set an example for all future
ages.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Obedience is the characteristic virtue
of our Society.</i> At the time of the Protestant Reformation
there was a widespread spirit of rebellion
against the authority of God; independence replaced
obedience. The Holy Ghost then inspired <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius
to institute a religious Order whose characteristic
virtue should be that of obedience. He had been a
brave soldier, and he wished to assemble a band of
men, a company obeying orders with the promptness,
punctuality and generosity of soldiers ever in active
warfare. “Especially I desire,” he writes, “to see
you most perfect in the virtue of obedience.” His
letter on Obedience is the greatest masterpiece written
on this matter, and his Institute is the most perfect
exhibition of this virtue in action. It is, in fact,
a close imitation of the obedient life of the God Incarnate.
None but very obedient men are true Jesuits.
Father Franciosi, in his work “The Spirit of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Ignatius,” has collected thirty pages of eulogies pronounced
by the Saint on this his favorite virtue (<abbr title='pages'>pp.</abbr>
61 to 92). He calls it “the noblest and most beautiful
virtue,” “the sweetest sacrifice, most pleasing to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>Divine Majesty,” “a kind of martyrdom.” He writes:
“Obedience ennobles and elevates man greatly above
his condition, causing him to put off self and to put
on God, the sovereign good, who is accustomed to
fill the soul so much the more as He finds it less
occupied with self-will; so that those who have reached
this state may truly, provided they obey from the bottom
of their hearts, say with the Apostle: ‘I live,
now not I, but Christ liveth in me.’”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. How perfect ought our obedience to
be?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>I. <i>In the execution</i>, it must be prompt, leaving
even a letter unfinished; exact, rendered with military
precision; generous, shirking no difficulty; universal in
all things commanded and even at a mere sign of a
superior’s will without an express command; without
show of reluctance, as a corpse is moved or an old
man’s staff employed.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. <i>In the will</i>, which is exchanged for the will of
the superior, so that there can be no conflict of wills.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. <i>In the judgment</i>, “as far as a devout will can
bend the understanding,” says <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, which can
always be done when there is no compelling evidence
to the contrary. Hence never any criticism, but such
docility as the child Jesus showed when taught by <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Joseph the rules of his trade without suggesting any
improvement.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i> with our dear Lord, asking for perfect
obedience.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>
  <h3 id='trid-f-4' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='four'>IV</abbr> <br> On Strength of Character</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude. Recall the words of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Paul</i>: “Be
not overcome by evil, but overcome evil by good”
(<abbr title='Romans'>Rom.</abbr> <abbr title='twelve'>xii</abbr>, 21).</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask to improve in vigor of character.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. What is strength of character?</i> It is
power of the will to control one’s own actions, independently
of one’s inclinations and of the opinions of
men. A weak character is led by mere feelings.
These must be brought under control, conquered by
the strength of the will and made to obey the dictate
of reason. For this purpose we must resist our inclinations:
<span lang="la">“<i>Vince teipsum</i>,”</span> “Conquer thyself”; <span lang="la">“<i>Tantum
profeceris quantum tibi vim intuleris</i>,”</span> “Your
progress will be proportioned to your self-victories,”
are undoubted maxims. And Christ says in the Apocalypse:
“To him that shall overcome I will give to sit
with me in my throne” (<abbr title='three'>iii</abbr>, 21).</p>

<p class='c007'>What must we overcome? Whatever we find during
the triduum to be disorderly in our daily conduct.
Examine your rising at the first signal, your morning
visit, meditation, hearing of Mass, reception of Holy
Communion, and all the successive actions of the day.
Resolve to correct what is faulty, to supply what is
wanting, etc. Mere wishes are worthless; you must
set to work.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. Whence comes strength of character?</i></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>1. It is of course, like every precious power, a gift
of God: “Every best gift, and every perfect gift is
from above, coming down from the Father of light”
(<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> James <abbr title='one'>i</abbr>, 17). Like all other gifts of God, it can
be increased by earnest and persevering prayer.
Many are fond of frequently repeating the petition:
“Lord, grant me the grace of doing what Thou commandest,
and then command what Thou wilt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>2. But it is not all a gift of God. Our will is free;
nothing is so truly our own as our will. Even God
will not control it. Being an immaterial power, it is
not affected by sickness nor old age, as is evident from
the heroism of the Martyrs.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. A person’s character may undergo great
changes. Thus we read of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Francis of Sales that
his gentleness of temper was the result of strenuous
and continuous efforts. In <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius “Unalterable
calmness was the result of his vigorous perseverance
in combatting the irascibility to which his constitution
much inclined him” (Franciosi, <abbr title='Spirituality'>Spir.</abbr> of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> <abbr title='Ignatius'>Ign.</abbr>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr>
149).</p>

<p class='c007'>4. Often men of strong passions make most progress
in virtue, as <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius found in Peter Ribadineira
and Edmund Auger, who triumphed over great
defects of character (<abbr title='Ibid'>Ib.</abbr>, <abbr title='page'>p.</abbr> 141).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. How is strength of character increased
or diminished?</i> This is chiefly effected by the
successive acts of our free will. Every virtuous act
strengthens our power of doing such virtuous acts
again, and every yielding to our passions strengthens
those passions, and in the same proportion weakens
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>our power of resistance to their promptings. For
habits are formed by the repetition of acts, and habits
become like a second nature. We are all bundles of
habits; the habits determine the cast of character.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is proper for each one to examine during the
triduum whether he is now different from what he
was at former times; for instance, at the completion
of his novitiate or his entrance on more active duties—better
or worse. We cannot long remain just the
same. The religious life is like rowing against the
current of a river: if we cease rowing, we are carried
back. What is my present condition of fidelity to
duty, of zeal, charity, obedience, piety, etc.?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i>, as the occasion suggests.</p>
<h3 id='trid-f-5' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='five'>V</abbr> <br> On Co-operation with Grace</h3>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Imagine you see the thousands of
happy souls in Heaven who worked out their salvation
in our Society while on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for abundant grace to follow in
their footsteps.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. What manner of men were they on
earth?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>They were very much like ourselves. They had the
same human passions to control, the same rules to observe,
the same labors to perform, the same sacrifices
to make, etc. And to help them along they had the
same aids that we have: the same loving Lord, who
had called them from amid the dangers of the world,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>as He has called us; the same training by the Spiritual
Exercises of <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Ignatius, the same holy Sacraments,
the same everything; not of course in the same proportion
for every individual soul; but enough of grace for
all to live up to our grand vocation, and in due time to
be with our blessed brethren in Heaven, as we are now
their associates in the Society of Jesus on earth.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. To what do those happy souls owe
their success?</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The same grace of God in their case and in ours
being presupposed, they owed their success to their
faithful co-operation. The grace of God is in the
matter of sanctification, what the spring is in a watch.
All the movements of the wheels and the hands come
from the spring; when that breaks all the other parts
come to a perfect standstill. The powers of our body
and soul are like the wheels of the watch which must
work along with the spring to indicate the correct time.
And of them one is free, namely our will. When our
free will co-operates with grace, we lead holy lives.
The spring of God’s grace never fails; the only fear of
failure regards our own free will. Now the purpose
of this triduum is to examine how faithfully our will
is seconding the promptings of grace. In this meditation
we must ask God’s light to understand the real
condition of our soul, and next examine our conduct
with care, to see whether our lives are up to the standard
of faithful and fervent religious. How is God
pleased with us? How are our superiors and our
brethren in religion satisfied? Has any one a right to
complain of us? What improvement can we make?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. How can we obtain an increase of
grace?</i> By prayer and faithful co-operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>1. <i>Prayer</i> is the universal means by which all blessings
can be obtained: “Ask and you shall receive,
that your joy may be full” (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> John <abbr title='sixteen'>xvi</abbr>, 24). But
of course we must pray fervently and perseveringly;
careless prayer leads to tepidity and loss of grace,
rather than its increase. How fervently have I been
praying of late?</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Co-operation with graces given me is the most
efficient means of obtaining a further supply of grace.
And in proportion as graces abound the service of God
is facilitated, and thus again further graces are secured:
<span lang="la"><i>Facile equitat quem gratia Dei portat</i></span>, “he
rides along with ease who is carried up by the grace
of God,” is a familiar axiom. On the other hand, the
want of co-operation with the grace given us makes
us unworthy of a future liberal supply of God’s help,
and gradually leads a soul into tepidity, with all its
serious consequences. We may be much encouraged
to improve ourselves in these two means of sanctification,
namely prayer and co-operation with grace, by
frequently recalling to mind the examples set us by
the Saints of our Society. These two means made
them Saints and the same means will make us Saints,
if we employ them with the same earnestness and perseverance
as they did. Pray like the Saints, co-operate
with the grace of God as the Saints habitually
did, and you will soon be holy yourselves.</p>

in the imitation of the Saints.</p>
<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>
  <h3 id='trid-f-6' class='c011'>MEDITATION <abbr title='six'>VI</abbr> <br> The Perfection of Our Actions</h3>
</div>
<p class='c006'><i><abbr title='first'>1st</abbr> Prelude.</i> Behold our Divine Lord as a youth
occupied in humble labor.</p>

<p class='c007'><i><abbr title='second'>2nd</abbr> Prelude.</i> Ask for light and strength of will to
do all things well.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='one'>I</abbr>. The life of Christ is summed up in the
words, “He hath done all things well,” <span lang="la">Bene omnia
fecit</span></i> (<abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr> Mark <abbr title='seven'>vii</abbr>, 37).</p>

<p class='c007'>For Jesuits these words contain a most safe, most
effective and most comprehensive rule of action. This
follows from the fact that our life is directly intended
to be a close imitation of the life of Christ Himself.
Such was certainly the grand ideal of our founder, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Ignatius. The perfection he teaches is the imitation
of Christ; and the entire life of Christ is described in
this statement, “He did all things well.” Any one of
Ours who aims steadily at this practise is on the highroad
to perfection; and one who does so throughout
his life is a real saint. To such persons applies the
saying of Father Isidore Boudreaux, <abbr class='spell'>S.J.</abbr>, which is
quoted in our Menology: “The good novice makes
the good scholastic and the good scholastic makes the
good priest.” Without this aim the pursuit of perfection
is an illusion.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='two'>II</abbr>. In this pursuit of sanctity we have no
time to lose.</i> See how much was done in a short time
by our young Saints, Aloysius, Stanislaus, Berchmans,
and really by all our great models. For instance, <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Francis had only ten years given him to accomplish his
grand success in India and Japan. Very many of the
Saints fulfilled a long space in a short time; a <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Catherine of Sienna, who benefited the Church so
conspicuously, died at the age of 33 years. The career
of any of you may be much briefer than you
expect; but no matter how brief it be, it will be a very
successful one if you do all things well.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>POINT <abbr title='three'>III</abbr>. What is required to do all things
well?</i> It requires:</p>

<p class='c007'>1. A good motive on all occasions; for the end
specifies the act, determines its moral nature. In all
your actions seek purely God’s glory, the good of
souls, the will of God, or any purpose that the faith
proposes to us. “Whether you eat or drink, or whatever
else you do, do all to the glory of God,” wrote <abbr title='Saint'>St.</abbr>
Paul (<abbr title='first'>I</abbr> <abbr title='Corinthians'>Cor.</abbr> <abbr title='ten'>x</abbr>, 31). It is not so much the offering
of our actions to God that is here recommended, but
rather the aiming in all we do at a supernatural effect.
This higher aim renders our acts pleasing to God and
meritorious for ourselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>2. Attention to the least details of what you do,
striving to impart to it the highest perfection you can.
Thus the perfection of any work of art depends, not
on the general outline only, but rather on the beauty
imparted to every portion of the production, be it a
painting, a statue, a literary composition, etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>3. Careful avoidance of all negligent or defective
work. For indulgence in carelessness not only spoils
the task actually in hand, but also renders us less disposed
to act well on subsequent occasions. Every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>moral fault we commit fosters an evil habit. Let me
examine with care with what perfection I have lately
been accustomed to perform my actions, and resolve
to amend all that needs correction.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Colloquy</i>, according to the present condition of my
soul.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
